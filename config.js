He fears for his life and the lives of others, which is why he made a makeshift mask for himself, using a coffee filter, taped to his skin. Volunteers of the French Red Cross, learning of his condition, exercise extra caution and fear of contaminating him. They know it would be fatal to him. "The marginalized are even more marginalized" confirms Mehi, seated on a bench, in a deserted city that resounds with a macabre silence. Fortunately, a bit later, when our two Red Cross volunteers help another homeless man, this silence is broken by the thousands of applause in honor of the medical staff.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/757915144314007/videos/2975020585853934/">See the video ...</a><p><i>Hugo Clement, Croix-Rouge Française</i></p>',

However, I am also aware of the risk that I might end up infected because of the fact that COVID19 is a highly contagious disease. I made a choice of becoming part of the COVID19 response team of the Philippine Red Cross Compostela Valley Chapter (Davao de Oro), thus staying at home has become a second option. </p><p>To make sure that my family is safe, I stayed in the quarter and didn\’t visit my family to secure their safety at home. It\'s been over a month since I didn\’t come home because my tasks in the COVID19 response includes Profiling of PUM and PUI at the barangays within the jurisdiction of the Province. I also helped the welfare service at the quarantine site with 33 stranded passengers from Manila who can\’t pass through the region\’s border because of the regional lockdown implemented. All of the passengers are subject to 14 days quarantine because all persons who travel from Metro Manila are considered PUM. We initiated to craft face shields for the frontliners, intensify the promotion of handwashing, regularly disinfect areas that people usually visit, and more. </p><p>Going out of the comfort zone to do fieldwork has always been uncertain with the possibilities of having been infected with the infectious disease, but I have also understood the hard work of the staff in the call for this humanitarian noble service.

Despite the high standard of living in Canada, the vulnerability of youth staying alone in their homes without neighbors or family support can create significant safety issues for themselves and their siblings as well as a fire risk in multi-family dwellings. Our youth program group immediately began to develop an online safety program for school-age children to increase their knowledge and skills in safety and injury prevention. The lessons learned from this quick programming platform change will then be applied to the other programs offered in Canada. We are also optimistic that this online method of sharing knowledge and skills can be implemented in our remote and isolated Communities In the very near future as well because they are highly underserved pollination of vulnerable people.</p><p>As I said before, this initiative and effort pale in comparison to the other stories shared in this forum but it also shows the diversity In which we as volunteers participate and contribute under the same name and principles in Canada and around the world.
