Right now, it’s easy to feel isolated, lonely, scared, and frustrated. You’re likely asking, “When’s all this Coronavirus stuff going to end?” “When can I get back to the way things were just last month?” Right now, it feels like life is uncertain, but one thing is undeniable (whether we acknowledge it or not), the need for human connection – even in a world of self-isolation and quarantine. And here’s how different RCs are enabling connections and social linkages between people who are isolated.
Inspired by the actions of the Italian Red Cross implemented during the first weeks of the crisis, the <b>French Red Cross</b> has set up an exceptional solidarity concierge system: «Red Cross Chez Vous». Anyone confined to social isolation can call 7 days a week from 8am to 8pm on 09 70 28 30 00 to benefit from a warm and reassuring support from a professional psychological help; reliable information on the situation - the possibility of ordering basic necessities (food, hygiene and maintenance products, medicines that Red Cross volunteers will deliver to them safely the next day.
<b>Australia</b> offers a volunteer phonecall service called Telecross, which is a daily phone call from a volunteer to check on the wellbeing of those experiencing vulnerability, increasing our response with this to meet the needs of those vulnerable and in quarantine. This is implemented through technical systems that allow for telephone outreach to be conducted by Red Cross people working remotely.
And finally, not just limited to those isolated or vulnerable, the <b>American RC</b> recognising that even us as Red Crossers need the same social support, initiated Project Wellness where Red Crossers call other Red Crossers to see how they’re doing. This is a purely optional volunteer and employee activity for those working remotely to join in if so inclined. This activity to make calls may be conducted at one’s convenience; there’s no deadline.
The ask is simple. Receive a list of volunteers to call and say, “Hi, this is ____, and I just want to see how you’re doing”…and let the conversation take it from there. It’s like calling your Aunt Betty in another state.

Going a step beyond offering psycho-social support, how can communities also be gainfully engaged that enables a wider range of services and a cross collaboration of likeminded to stay active and contribute meaningfully during this crisis? How can the crises help in rethinking engagement of volunteers?
<b>Austria</b> is scaling up activities and increasing its volunteer base via the <a href=""https://www.teamoesterreich.at/corona/"">Online platform “Team Österreich”</a>. The platform has been created by the Red Cross and the Austrian broadcasting station Ö3 in 2007 and has around 65.000 members all over the country. Now, TÖ is bringing together short time (spontaneous) volunteers and people or institutions in need of help. Over 3.000 people have registered in the last days offering their support for people in quarantine or the elderly. 200 ""Team Österreich"" members have so far supported the national telephone hotline. In addition, helpers are available and connected with elderly people/people in home quarantine to do the necessary shopping. <a href=""https://webapp.teamoesterreich.at/index.html"">Via the online platform</a> also elderly people or people in quarantine can register and ask for help. Support will be organised and coordinated over the platform.
In <b>Switzerland</b>, The<b> App</b><a href=""http://www.fiveup.org/""> Five up</a> is available as a matching platform for volunteers and people in need of services facilitating neighbourhood services. Launched by the Swiss RC and SGG, the ap registered an unprecedented surge in use in the previous week (more than 1800 matches were facilitated, 40’000 times downloaded in late March).
In<b> Denmark</b>, the Danish Red Cross Youth (DRCY) has initiated ways to engage young people through <b>#CoronaVenner (CoronaFriends)</b> reaching out to children and youth in special need of social, structural and homework support in order to make their current life at home manageable. Corona Friends offers services through local activities and at national levels, 1:1 online relations or online groups sessions focusing on the individual child's needs - whether it is a daily wakeup call, some structural support to get through the day, online social gathering through music, gaming, videos etc. or homework support/tutoring and will be matched with the most suitable volunteer.
The CoronaFriends initiative has received a donation from the Tuborg Foundation on 500.000 DKK.
And extending the types of support to young people amidst the crises, DRCY shared online video tutorials on how to easily edit videos and tell stories via mobile phones. This allows young people to document experiences and ideas on handling the coronavirus challenge, while developing a relevant skill such as videomaking and storytelling through participatory media.

I learned that this virus brought people together much more than it separated them, and united them for a cause, for a common purpose. That makes me very satisfied and proud. Volunteering in this situation made me feel truly useful as I had never felt in any previous volunteering. In the region where I am, the red cross was getting erased, and despite the whole situation, we are managing to reactivate the volunteering of the local red cross, with this return to the origins, where we gathered the community to help in times of war.
We are achieving with our work aimed at the elderly and vulnerable to transmit hope and confidence to overcome this phase. We continue to try daily to provide support in all needs so that people can feel supported.
The main challenge to deal with is fear, ours and that of the people we support, however, we must continue to transmit security.","First of all, thank you for the opportunity to share experiences.

La vida de todos se ha movido de sitio desde la irrupción del Covid-19.
Desde el primer día que me quedé en casa, comencé a planear cómo poder ayudar.
Enseguida las redes vecinales se pusieron en marcha y la prudencia ante los contagios con ellas.
Si colaborar trae como consecuencia más ayuda para los voluntarios que se exponen, no haríamos sino agrandar el problema.Había que racionalizar.
En cuanto escuché en radio la puesta en marcha de Guztion Artean, llamé para ofrecerme como voluntaria a cualquier servicio que fuera necesario y pronto fuí convocada por Cruz Roja para participar.
Sólo necesitaba mis ganas y mi tiempo, y empezar a compartir para combatir.
Así llegué a la sede, con nervios, mascarilla y toda la ilusión y ganas del mundo.
Y así comenzamos, mi compañero Juan Carlos y yo a acercarnos todos los días a los Mercadona de Vitoria para hacer recogida de alimentos con los que paliar la pobreza de medios de nuestros conciudadanos. Pobreza que era puntual, o no existía, y que con la pandemia en un tris se hizo endémica.
Esta es la oportunidad de pasar de los pensamientos a las palabras y, de éstas a los hechos.
La mascarilla pica, hay que madrugar, a veces no recibimos tanto como quisiéramos... pero la satisfacción de ser de los pocos andantes callejeros que luchan contra el Covid-19, dan por bueno cualquier esfuerzo que parezca vano.
Vamos a ganarle el reto al virus porque no vamos a dejar de luchar. Hasta que no queden fuerzas y hasta que nos quede vida y dignidad.

Desde siempre había querido ayudar a la gente pero nunca parecía encontrar el tiempo. Ahora estaba en desempleo y le estaba dando vueltas a la posibilidad de colaborar, cuando la pandemia del Covid-19 estalló y tuve claro que algo tenía que hacer. He sido muy afortunado de haber convivido mucho con mis mayores, que vivieron tiempos mucho más duros y siempre admiré su capacidad de sufrimiento, su optimismo como relativizar lo que no es importante. Y este virus es especialmente cruel con ellos, por lo que poder ayudar a estas personas que viven solas es perfecto para mí.
Espero sinceramente que esta crisis nos haga ver las injusticias y las diferencias que existen en la sociedad. Que todos estos aplausos y gestos de solidaridad se conviertan en parte de nuestras vidas, de nuestro modo de ver la realidad. Tengo dos hijos preadolescentes y espero que lo que yo haga les sirva de ejemplo para ser más generosos, más abiertos a otra gente y que no den su bienestar por hecho. Y que sirva para darse cuenta de que el ser humano es insignificante ante un virus o ante la naturaleza, y que tomen conciencia de que tenemos que cuidar de los demás y del planeta.

Me sorprende no echar en absoluto de menos las tiendas, las cafeterías, los cines…
Siempre he vivido el compromiso social pero es la primera vez que lo hago a través de una organización estructurada, y aunque aun mi experiencia es mínima, tengo que decir que está siendo muy buena, porque es gratificante compartir un trabajo de grupo donde todo el mundo es positivo y generoso. Es mucho más llevadero que ir sola. Por otra parte, esta pandemia se está ensañando con una generación que ha sufrido mucho y gratifica poder contribuir a darles un poco de consuelo.
Esta pandemia nos ha parado en seco como sociedad y pienso que se seguirán dando situaciones similares. Me ha quedado muy claro lo vulnerables que somos, lo absurdo de querer controlarlo todo, la inutilidad de ir tras la seguridad egoísta postergando la vida propia y pasando por encima de la de los demás. Va a ser muy duro para todos aprender a vivir de otra manera.
Lo que he visto por primera vez con ocasión del Covid 19, o es la primera vez que me he hecho consciente es la limitación o conculcación de derechos civiles en pro de la seguridad, y eso da miedo.
Creo que es hora de estimular la solidaridad de abajo arriba, con los cercanos, con la comunidad de vecinos, con la asociación del barrio…Creo que es hora de hacernos conscientes y responsables de nuestras vidas y de la sociedad a nivel personal: con un cambio de vida en cuanto al consumo, al respeto por la naturaleza, al respeto por los demás no permitiendo ningún trabajo indigno…A ver si somos capaces!! Creo que o nos queda otra.
Gracias!!!!",Spanish Red Cross,ES,Spanish,es,Carmen,,,,I was very clear how vulnerable we are,"Dear friends committed to others, the experience of this pandemic is still very strong, and I have personally gone through a few moods, from the agonizing burden of seeing that we are in a global prison no escape, fear of uncertainty of which will be the consequences if you get caught the virus, thanks for able and willing to look into and take care of oneself in every way, and excitement to the check back a humanized and caring society. I'm surprised not take him at all shops, cafes, cinemas ...
I have always lived social commitment but it is the first time I do it through a structured organization, and although even my experience is minimal, I must say that being very good, because it is rewarding to share a group work where everyone it is positive and generous.

Al principio me desesperaba porque mandaba correos y llamaba a unos y otros y nadie me activaba, el saber que puedo ayudar y no poder hacerlo no me gustaba, pero la magia surgió y gracias a nohelia e Isabel empecé de una manera mágica, con unos compañeros muy especiales, con las que hice equipo muy rápido.
Días después de dar todo encontré situaciones de política y poder entre los que nos dirigen, eso hizo que quisiera irme a mi casa y que cuando se aclarasen que me llamará porque mi tiempo tiene un valor y no estoy aquí para perderlo o ver tonterías de poder. Mi tecnico me pidió paciencia u que no la dejara, con lo cual por lealtad y deseo de ayudar me quede y hasta ahora trabajando a tope con las personas que me llenan y viviendo experiencias preciosas, sintiendo como personas de varias escalas sociales, se emocionan cuando nos ven llegar, entre llorosos y felices (personas que empiezan a pasar hambre, personas que nunca necesitaron pedir alimentos pufff imagínense...)
<b>¿Cómo ha cambiado el brote de coronavirus tu vida diaria?</b>
Para mi es muy sencillo.
Me considero una persona muy estable y me adapto a todo lo que surge viendo las cosas buenas de cada situación.
Así que disfrutando mi sofá con mucho amor 💓
<b>¿Qué has aprendido del brote de coronavirus?</b>
Más que aprender, me hace recordar:
Somos frágiles
Necesitamos estar unidos
No somos más que nadie por tener materia o formación
Luchar por los demás hace una cadena humana que nos une y por desgracia esta locura nos está uniendo
<b>En el contexto de Coronavirus, ¿qué has hecho que te enorgullece?</b>
Quedarme en casa fielmente
Ser paciente
Aconsejar por varios medios y a todos los míos casi dos semanas antes de que el gobierno actuara de que hicieran una cuarentena voluntaria, creo que ayude a muchas personas
<b>Como persona voluntaria, ¿cuál es el principal desafío durante este brote de Covid-19?</b>
Salvar vidas
Y mientras conecto con personas que además se derrumban poder dar parte de mi fuerza interna, que se sientan protegidos desde un emblema que cuando aparece da tranquilos
<b>¿Qué has visto por primera vez debido a Covid-19?</b>
Estoy acostumbrado a vivir situaciones complicadas, pero creo que por primera vez vi a un pueblo mirando en una misma dirección y eso me emociona
<b>¿Cómo crees que el ánimo y la esperanza pueden aumentar a través de nuestra respuesta al coronavirus?</b>
No siendo fríos
Cuando estamos con personas más débiles dando nuestra potencia, a veces solo una mirada da fuerza a un ejército
Así que cuando vamos a ver a nuestro pueblo y da dar comida, también debemos dar un algo que no es material, se llama fuerza interna, se llama magia, se llama espíritu, se llama AMOR",Spanish Red Cross,ES,Spanish,es,Fernándo,,,,"It is called internal force, is called magic, is called spirit, is called LOVE","<B> What has been your experience volunteering in Covid-19?

me animaré a contaros mi historia en estos días como voluntaria en el COVID-19,:
Tras un tiempo como voluntaria, antes había sido con niños en cáritas, una gran experiencia, y desde entonces hasta ahora en cruz roja no había tomado mi actividad como voluntaria,  me apunte a cruz roja, pues me gusta su labor, cuando me avisasteis para que me apuntaría a la labor especial del covid-19, seleccioné la opción telefónica, me gusta comunicarme y por mi trabajo comercial, ahora en esta pandemia, teletrabajo, lo cierto es que me gusta hablar con la gente y poder ayudarle a traves de una conversación telefónica, y más en estos momentos de confinamiento en que las personas más vulnerables necesitan expresar sus inquietudes y miedos..., en mi trabajo diario, cuando llamo a clientes, en ocasiones, lo que a veces ocurre es que la conversación pasa de ser comercial, a personal, la gente es receptiva a la llamada comercial, que acaba siendo una conversación de dos personas que necesitan una relación social y comunicarse con otras personas, especialmente las personas que viven solas, o aún acompañadas que se sienten en soledad,en fin estas personas aún estando pasando un momento angustioso, por la situacion del Covid-19, aún sintiendose o estando solas en su hogar, al menos tienen recursos para su vida diaria, las necesidades básicas cubiertas, el primer sábado en el voluntariado de Covid-19 de Cruz Roja, hablé con personas en riesgo, vulnerables, por su situción socioecónomica y su estado de salud, debido a su edad, y recibes el mensaje de la injusticia, e intentas darles ánimos, me sorprendió la llamada en la que me contestó un chico que estaba como en shock, pues me contó que su madre y él estaban en cuarentena desde antes del decreto, al comienzo de la pandemia, por haber tenido contacto con personas enfermas, y que su hermano estaba ingresado, y que su cuñada también estaba igual que ellos, y que ya no les podía ayudar a su madre ya mayor y enferma y a él, y que no sabía que hacer pues necesitaban alimentos y medicina, asi que les proporcioné el teléfono donde les brindarían la asistencia que les haria falta, y él me contestó; ah claro, y me dió las gracias, el chico estaba desesperado porque veia que se estaban quedando sin viveres y medicina, pero no reaccionó a pedir ayuda, y al acabar la conversación, respiré ondo, y me di cuenta de lo  necesario que es el apoyo de Cruz Roja, en momentos como los que vivimos, en los que las personas más vulnerables a veces no reaccionan ante el miedo imagino, que les paralizó...en fin, tampoco quiero desanimaros con otras llamadas que entraron, lo cierto es que después del fin de semana de voluntariado, me di cuenata de lo afortunados que somos una fran cantidad de personas, que aún confinados, trabajamos, tenemos necesidades básicas cubiertas, salud y la compañia de los nuestros, en casa y a traves del teléffono, asi que preguntais desde esta propuesta de que contemos entre otras cosas, que qué hemos aprendido, una de las cosas, que a pesar de lo duro del confinamiento, aún lo seguimos teniendo todo aquellos que contamos con medios ecónomicos para ir tirando y una familia y amigos en quien apoyarnos aunque sea en la distancia, y la salud para poder seguir luchando con los nuestros, y con el resto de convecinos, también aprecié que hay gente que nunca cambia, pese a que vivamos una situación de máxima sensibilidad hacia los demás, y que aún asi, debemos de seguir e intentar hacerles ver otra visión de las cosas, que por intentarlo que no sea..., mi principal desafio es mantener el ánimo para que los demás no decaigan, y saber respirar ondo unos minutos si hace falta, para seguir con la tarea diaria... cada una la que nos toque... e igualmente como voluntaría, saber oir a la persona que llamo y ayudar en la medida de lo posible a las más vulnerables y necesitadas, y hacerles mantener la fe de que pronto recibirán ayuda, o el momento de que esto acabe, poder transmitirle entusiasmo en la medida de lo posible a cada persona...lo que he visto por primera vez como voluntaria ha sido la desesperación de una forma... no sé como expresarlo... digamos que la desesperación abstracta... porque es difícil a veces saber el punto de necesidad de afecto, compañia, alimentos, confort básico en estos días de frio..., unido a la desesperación del confinamiento... ese es un gran desafio, hacerles sentir a las personas con la que me comunico que esto y su situación cambiará... a mejor, asi que creo que la esperanza, la fe, la pasión en estos momentos no debe de faltarnos, pues a veces una llamada corta de un minuto por el voluntariado de Cruz Roja, es todo un mundo para las personas desprotegidas... os animo pues a todos los que compartis experiencias en los diferentes departamentos del voluntariado en cualquier lugar o aquí en Cruz Roja, a seguir hacia delante con los momentos que podais dedicar, pues no hay nada mejor para un voluntario, que sentir que su pequeña aportación sirvió de gran ayuda, eso debe ser un gran motivo de orgullo para todos, las personas a las que ayudamos seguro que así lo pensarán. Ánimo y a seguir con entusiasmo. cada labor que realizamos es necesaria para algunos.

Por ello  decido averiguar  qué posibilidades hay para poder colaborar y me comentan que el voluntariado  se está gestionando desde Cruz Roja. Consigo contactar con Cruz Roja y después de hablar con ellos e intercambiar información me dan la oportunidad  de comenzar mi voluntariado en el albergue Pio Baroja el 20 de marzo.
El coronavirus me a afectado en las relaciones familiares y sociales, ya que desde antes de que se definieran las medidas de aislamiento ya las comencé a tomar en relación a mis padres: antes iba a diario a comer con ellos y no he vuelto a estar con ellos desde el 12 de Marzo. Las relaciones de amistad ahora son on-line...Respecto al trabajo apenas llevo una semana de teletrabajo...mejor dicho en adaptación del teletrabajo. Lo que si he eliminado de mis rutinas diarias , es el deporte...:(...y he aumentado las visitas a la nevera...
Del brote del coronavirus he aprendido la vulnerabilidad  de nuestra vida.....y el juego de  domino de nuestro sistema de vida a nivel global. Y sobre todo el trabajo que realiza Cruz Roja...Me ha ayudado a conocer más de cerca esta ONG.
Lo que más me enorgullece  de todo este tiempo es formar parte del equipo de voluntariado  de Cruz Roja  en el albergue y especialmente el cambio que noto día a día en la organización y funcionamiento del servicio desde su comienzo en Pio Baroja.....El trabajo del responsable, técnicos, voluntarios y usuarios hacen que cada día tenga sentido el acudir al albergue para poder ayudar en diferentes funciones....un trabajo en equipo realmente motivador y con muy buen feeling. Sin lugar a duda el equipo humano es impresionante y la dedicación  que se ve así como el cariño que se siente por parte de los más veteranos...
Respecto al ánimo y la esperanza, yo creo que ayuda mucho el dar a conocer los diferentes servicios  y proyectos en los que se están trabajando desde Cruz Roja y la posibilidad de poder colaborar a las personas interesadas....Y por supuesto  las personas que les esta tocando vivir en el albergue sienten que también  se les tiene en cuenta en esta crisis como a otros colectivos...y eso también les da esperanza...

217934,En muchas conversaciones se palpa en el fondo un problema de soledad,http://future-rcrc.com/testimonial/en-muchas-conversaciones-se-palpa-en-el-fondo-un-problema-de-soledad/,"Mon, 06 Apr 2020 12:57:27 +0000",http://future-rcrc.com/?post_type=wpm-testimonial&p=217934,"Me apunté como voluntaria, contaron conmigo y he atendido llamadas en el centro de coordinación de Cruz Roja ubicado en Vitoria  hasta el momento durante tres únicos días. Allí he podido comprobar la diferente casuística de la gente que necesita ayuda. La centralita del programa, -destinado en principio a la proporción de alimentos y medicinas a mayores de 70 años sin red de apoyo-, se ve desbordada por las peticiones de personas sin recursos, mayoritariamente inmigrantes y de raza gitana, que por culpa del COVID 19 han perdido sus trabajos o no pueden salir a la calle a buscar empleo.
Según refieren, los solicitantes son adultos jóvenes o de mediana edad con niños a su cargo y sin ingresos, que han sido atendidos en alguna ocasión por Cruz Roja y en el pasado, aunque sólo a veces, han estado cobrado la RGI. Demandan insistentemente comida, pañales o incluso empleo y se sienten atrapados ante el desbordamiento actual de los servicios sociales de base, que extienden sus citas en el tiempo, y la red  institucional de emergencia social, que no da abasto. Coordinar la atención y precisar la respuesta al demandante es en mi opinión uno de los mayores retos actuales del voluntariado. Este no sólo debe hacer frente al reparto racional de los recursos, siempre escasos y más ante la crisis del COVID 19, sino contribuir a implementar la confianza en el sistema impidiendo que los solicitantes entren en un bucle de llamadas a los distintos servicios. Y todo ello, al mismo tiempo que trata de detectar las necesidades reales y evitar la picaresca.
En cuanto a las personas mayores la problemática es igualmente dispar. A la necesidad de recibir comida y medicinas por no poder salir de casa se une en estos momentos la carencia de los servicios de asistentas  y empleadas de hogar. En muchos casos, y aun pudiendo acudir a las distintas casas, dejan de trabajar por distintos motivos: grupos de riesgo, miedo al contagio, cuidado de niños pequeños…
En muchas conversaciones se palpa en el fondo un problema de soledad por lo que la llamada de la Cruz Roja siempre es bien recibida. Hay mayores que no tienen familia y otros que la tienen lejos y se sienten aislados, más si cabe en esta situación en que su movilidad ha sido totalmente restringida y el  miedo se extiende.
Por mi trabajo anterior no me he visto sorprendida  por ninguna de estas realidades aunque sí me he dado cuenta de que ante una crisis como la actual la lista de necesidades puede ser interminable y  descender hasta detalles en principio tan nimios como el traslado de una pilas de audífono al hospital para una persona sorda allí ingresada o la desconexión de una vía a un minusválido tras la atención dispensada por hospitalización a domicilio. Socorrer a un camarero de Leioa en Dubai a quien van a desahuciar y no puede regresar a España da idea de hasta qué punto está extendida la imagen de la Cruz Roja como organismo de último recurso.
Organizar al voluntariado y seleccionar a los voluntarios más adecuados  me parece otro de los retos actuales ante la avalancha de solicitudes. Hay personas, sobre todo jóvenes, ansiosos de colaborar a los que inscribirse a través de una página web y no recibir respuesta les desilusiona. Por otro lado, al teléfono se tiene la impresión de que hay perfiles más aprovechables que otros (ertzainas, ATS, auxiliares…) que a lo mejor podrían ser identificados de forma preferente.
El COVID 19 ha cambiado mi percepción de la realidad. De repente los humanos del Primer Mundo nos hemos convertido en seres vulnerables por la pandemia, que vemos cómo muere gente a nuestro alrededor y las libertades de las que gozábamos quedan de momento suspendidas. Habrá un antes y un después, eso es evidente, porque a la crisis sanitaria seguirá una económica mayor que la de 2008.
Al no estar ya trabajando, las limitaciones impuestas por el COVID 19 se centran en mi caso en el reagrupamiento familiar, la formación y el ocio.  El estar en casa  y no salir no ha supuesto ningún esfuerzo por mi parte. Al contrario, ha representado una oportunidad para destinar tiempo a un sinfín de actividades, incluida la del voluntariado, que siempre he ido relegando por una razón u otra. Dado que en mi ámbito de amistades hay gente contagiada por el coronavirus o que ha perdido algún familiar he intentado transmitirles ánimo y confianza poniéndome en contacto con ellos a menudo, interesándome por su situación y tratando de  aportar algún consuelo, o cuando menos escuchando. También atendí la solicitud de cartas de apoyo anónimas a los ingresados enviada desde una médico perteneciente, creo, al equipo del Hospital de la Princesa de Madrid. Poco  más he hecho, la verdad, salvo reanudar el contacto con familiares y amigos a los que no suelo ver por vivir en otras ciudades y extremar la higiene en mi domicilio al convivir con un sanitario,
No soy una experta en Trabajo Social y no sé cómo infundir ánimo y esperanza a los desanimados y desesperanzados, sabiendo también que uno no puede involucrarse en exceso y perder la perspectiva y que su aportación siempre será un granito de arena en la inmensidad de las necesidades que atiende el tercer sector.
En mi opinión la atención, el escuchar, puede ser útil, y sobre todo  el transmitir la sensación de que las personas te importan  y de verdad quieres ayudarle a resolver   problemas o gestiones. Hay que tener en cuenta que asuntos en principio sencillos se pueden convertir en un mundo para personas mayores. Poniéndome en su lugar considero que lo peor es que se vean tratados como los clientes o usuarios que se pelean con cintas automáticas grabadas de distintas multinacionales, a quienes derivan de un sitio a otro, tratando de evitar “el marrón”.",Spanish Red Cross,ES,Spanish,es,Montse,,,,In many conversations palpated at bottom a problem of loneliness,"I signed up as a volunteer, they told me and I have attended calls the focal point of Red Cross located in Vitoria so far only for three days. There I could see the casuistry different from the people who need help. The switchboard of the program, -intended in principle to the proportion of food and medicine for over 70 years without network support-, is overwhelmed by the demands of poor people, mostly immigrants and gypsies, that because of the COVID 19 have lost their jobs or can not go out to seek employment.
According refer applicants are young or middle-aged adults with dependent children and no income, they have been served on occasion by the Red Cross and in the past, but only sometimes, have been charged GIR. insistently demanding food, diapers or employment and feel trapped in the current overflow of basic social services, extending their appointments in time, and the institutional network of social emergency, which can not cope. Coordinate care and clarify the answer to the plaintiff is in my opinion one of the biggest challenges of current volunteering. This should not only deal with the rational distribution of resources, always scarce and more in the crisis of the COVID 19, but contribute to implementing confidence in the blocking system that applicants enter a loop calls to different services. And all at the same time trying to identify the real needs and avoid picaresque.
As for older people the problem is equally mixed. The need for food and medicine for being unable to leave home right now joins the lack of services housemaids and domestic workers. In many cases, and can even go to different houses, they stop working for various reasons: risk groups, fear of contagion, care of young children ...
In many conversations palpated at bottom a problem of loneliness so the call from the Red Cross is always well received. There are older who have no family and others who are far away and feel isolated, more so in this situation where mobility has been completely restricted and fear spreads.
For my previous work I have not been surprised by any of these realities though I have themselves realized that a crisis like the current list of needs can be endless and down to details at first as minor as moving a cell headset to the hospital for a deaf person there entered or disconnection of a path to a disabled person after hospitalization care provided at home. Help a waiter in Dubai Leioa who will evict and can not return to Spain it gives an idea of ​​how widespread is the image of the Red Cross as a body of last resort.
Organize volunteers and select the most suitable volunteers I think one of the current challenges before the avalanche of applications. Some people, especially young people, eager to assist those who sign up through a website and no response disappoints them. On the other hand, the phone you have the impression that there are more profitable than others profiles (ertzainas, ATS, assistants ...) that perhaps could be identified as a priority.
The COVID 19 has changed my perception of reality. Suddenly humans from the First World we have become vulnerable beings by the pandemic, we see how people die around us and we enjoyed freedoms that are currently suspended. There will be a before and after, that's obvious, because the health crisis will remain an economic higher than in 2008.
In the no longer working, the limitations imposed by the COVID 19 focus on my case family reunification, education and leisure. Being at home and not out has had no effort on my part. In contrast, it represented an opportunity to spend time with endless activities, including the volunteer, I've always been relegated for one reason or another. Because in my field of friends there are people infected by the coronavirus or have lost a family member tried to convey courage and confidence getting in touch with them often, being interested in their situation and trying to bring some comfort, or at least listening. Also attended the request for letters of support anonymous admitted belonging sent from a doctor, I think, to the team of the Hospital de la Princesa in Madrid. I have done little more, really, except renew contact with family and friends who do not watch live in other cities and extreme hygiene in my home to live with the health,
I am not an expert in social work and do not know how to instill courage and hope to the despondent and hopeless, also knowing that you can not get involved too much and lose perspective and your contribution will always be a grain of sand in the vastness of the needs attending the third sector.
In my opinion the attention, listening, may be useful, and above all convey the feeling that the people you care about and really want to help you solve problems or steps. It should be borne in mind that simple principle issues can become a world for seniors. I consider putting in its place the worst is that they see treated as customers or users who quarrel with automatic tapes recorded from different multinationals, who derive from one place to another, trying to avoid ""brown"".","I signed up as a volunteer, they told me and I have attended calls the focal point of Red Cross located in Vitoria so far only for three days.

According to what they refer, the applicants are young or middle-aged adults with children in their care and without income, who have been cared for on occasion by the Red Cross and in the past, although only sometimes, have received the RGI.

Due to my previous work, I have not been surprised by any of these realities, although I have realized that in the face of a crisis such as the current one, the list of needs can be endless and go down to details that are at first as trivial as the transfer of a pile of hearing aid to the hospital for a deaf person admitted there or the disconnection of a route for a disabled person after the care provided by hospitalization at home. Helping a Leioa waiter in Dubai who is going to be evicted and cannot return to Spain gives an idea of the extent to which the image of the Red Cross as a body of last resort is widespread.
Organizing volunteers and selecting the most suitable volunteers seems to me another of the current challenges in the face of the avalanche of applications. There are people, especially young people, eager to collaborate and those who sign up through a website and do not receive a response are disappointed. On the other hand, the phone has the impression that there are more profitable profiles than others (ertzainas, ATS, auxiliaries ...) that could perhaps be identified preferentially.
COVID 19 has changed my perception of reality. Suddenly, humans in the First World have become vulnerable beings due to the pandemic, we see how people around us die and the liberties that we enjoyed are suspended for the moment. There will be a before and an after, that is evident, because the health crisis will be followed by an economic crisis greater than that of 2008.
As I am no longer working, the limitations imposed by COVID 19 focus in my case on family reunification, training and leisure. Being home and not going out has not been an effort on my part. On the contrary, it has represented an opportunity to dedicate time to endless activities, including volunteering, which I have always been relegating for one reason or another. Given that in my area of friends there are people infected by the coronavirus or who have lost a family member, I have tried to convey encouragement and confidence by contacting them often, taking an interest in their situation and trying to provide some comfort, or at least listening. I also attended the request for anonymous letters of support to those admitted sent from a doctor belonging, I believe, to the team at the Hospital de la Princesa in Madrid.
I am not an expert in Social Work and I do not know how to instill encouragement and hope in the discouraged and hopeless, also knowing that one cannot become overly involved and lose perspective and that their contribution will always be a grain of sand in the vastness of needs serving the third sector.
In my opinion, attention, listening, can be useful, and especially transmitting the feeling that people matter to you and you really want to help them solve problems or managements. It must be borne in mind that in principle simple matters can become a world for the elderly. Putting myself in their place I consider that the worst thing is that they are treated as customers or users who fight with recorded automatic tapes of different multinationals, who they refer from one place to another, trying to avoid ""the mess"".

Voy de maravilla. Y el Covid-19 me ha dado la oportunidad de devolver...agradecer de alguna manera (muy pequeña) lo bien que me esta yendo y lo bien
que me han tratado médicos, enfermeras... a pesar de todo. Es como que debo algo a la sociedad. Y esta es mi oportunidad.
Como a todos. El no salir de casa solo lo estrictamente necesario me esta haciendo buscarme entretenimientos. Pero me gustaban mis rutinas y las sigo haciendo de otra manera.
Daba largos paseos, hacía fotografía, leía, visitaba a mis padres, quedaba con amig@s... Ahora hemos desempolvado la bici estática, los ejercicios de rehabilitación.
Hacemos videollamadas, las fotos en casa... Y se va el día en general sin enterarme.
Lo primero a ser más concienzuda con la higiene. Y después me he dado cuenta de lo frágiles que somos.
Mejorar si cabe los lazos familiares y de amistad en general. Hablamos a diario... Y el voluntariado.

Cuéntanos tu historia</b>
Soy Pilar Carrasco Calvo, voluntaria del “Grup de Gent Gran” del Masnou, en Barcelona. Somos un grupo muy activo, con un equipo de voluntari@s consolidado y un buen número de usuari@s que nos hacen vivir la magia del voluntariado día a día. El dia 11 de marzo, siguiendo las indicaciones de Cruz Roja de Cataluña, se suspendieron  todas las actividades grupales que se realizaban con personas mayores. También se suspendieron actuaciones presenciales con nuestros usuarios. Debido a que pertenezco al grupo de riesgo por mi edad (73 años) y instada por mi familia, decidí confinarme en casa. Me ofrecí al 100% des de mi domicilio y siiii así empezó mi experiencia de voluntariado en Covid-19.
<b>¿Cómo ha cambiado el brote de coronavirus tu vida diaria?</b>
Esencialmente ha cambiado mi ritmo de vida. Llevo tres semanas de confinamiento y mi actividad voluntaria no se ha visto mermada en absoluto!!! Des del día 1 hago “televoluntariado”. En nuestra asamblea tenemos 268 usuarios a los que estamos haciendo seguimiento y detección de necesidades.
<b>¿Qué has aprendido del brote de coronavirus?</b>
Lo vulnerables que somos los seres humanos y como la naturaleza nos habla...
<b>En el contexto de Coronavirus, ¿qué has hecho que te enorgullece?</b>
Mantener vivo el espíritu voluntario. Ocupar las mañanas haciendo llamadas telefónicas a nuestros usuarios y “acompañar” verdaderamente “acompañar” su confinamiento, que también es el mio. Me enorgullece porque SE que para ellos son muy importante nuestras llamadas, porque se sienten acompañados, queridos, respetados... y sobre todo saben que ESTAMOS A SU LADO. Así nos lo manifiestan, así nos lo hacen sentir.
<b>¿Como persona voluntaria, ¿cuál es el principal desafío durante este brote de Covid-19?</b>
Mantener alto el ánimo de nuestros usuarios. Para ello hacemos seguimiento telefónico, para ello hemos creado un grupo reducido de whatsapp en el que los profesores de gimnasia y relajación nos envían ejercicios para mantener  sanos el cuerpo y la mente.
<b>¿Qué has visto por primera vez debido a Covid-19?</b>
El dolor de una usuaria al perder a su marido y no poder acompañarlo en sus últimos días, no poder despedirse, velarlo...
<b>¿Cómo crees que el ánimo y la esperanza pueden aumentar a través de nuestra respuesta al coronavirus?</b>
Como voluntaria de Cruz Roja me emociona la capacidad que tiene la entidad para organizarse, desplegarse... para SER Y ESTAR ante catastrofes como esta. Con AMOR, CORAJE, UNION.",Spanish Red Cross,ES,Spanish,es,Pillar,,,,I offered to 100% des siiii I live and so began my volunteer experience in Covid-19,"<B> What has been your experience volunteering in Covid-19?

<Ol>
 <Li> The volunteer experience that just started has been very pleasant. Something new for me, who had never done. I come from the world of administration, commerce, business economics, etc ... although they have in common continuous contact with people, it's another world. </Li>
 <Li> Totally and absolutely. I have been taken out of the routine, as have a lot of very active people. I have gone from a lot of physical and mental activity, to a forced and unexpected stop in which we look helpless because we do not know how to fight. Now there is an adaptation to this inactivity that does not hurt to reflect otherwise. </Li>
 <Li> That nothing can be taken for granted. However farsighted that we can be,  there may be a greater force pulling the deck of cards towards us.    </Li>
 <Li> Well this about volunteering, and trying to calm my family and friends. And solve small problems that arise because your means of earning a living has been modified.  </Li>
 <Li> Try to help in situations worse than mine, and feel useful.</Li>
 <Li> That we are all interconnected even if we think that we are independent. But it's not like that. And it is up to all of us to create hope that we will overcome it, without fear. Because fear is worse than any virus. </Li>

Depuis le début de l’épidémie, <a href=""https://www.croix-rouge.be/2020/04/03/coronavirus-appels-sisu/"">le centre d’appel fédéral reçoit onze mille appels par jour. Nous, on est la deuxième ligne, le Sisu : <b>S</b>ervice d’<b>I</b>ntervention Psycho-<b>S</b>ociale <b>U</b>rgente de la Croix-Rouge.</a> On prend les appels liés aux questions <em>« psy »</em>.  À chaque nouvelle décision du conseil national de sécurité, il y a de plus en plus d’inquiétude. C’est du cas par cas.
Je suis en ligne avec un papa. Son fils de quatre ans se réveille deux fois par nuit. Il fait des crises de nerf comme jamais, malgré sa disponibilité maximale. Il a écumé toutes les vidéos de yoga pour enfant sur Instagram et tous les post Pinterest pour construire un château de la Reine des Neiges avec des rouleaux de papier toilettes et des boîtes de sardines. Vingt histoires par jour, une chasse au trésor, troisième cabanes dans le salon et quarante-quatre ateliers dessin plus tard, pour lui, le confinement n’est pas l’occasion d’une recherche intérieure profonde ou le meilleur moment pour (re)lire les quatre mille pages <em>d’À la recherche du temps perdu</em> écrites par le plus célèbre des auteurs confinés, mais une prison domestique ! Il n’arrête pas de s’engueuler avec sa compagne. Ils ne peuvent plus se voir en peinture. Ce matin, il a découvert les bras de son fils couverts d’eczéma. À l’épuisement et au stress, s’ajoutent maintenant l’impuissance et la culpabilité.
Je suis devenue bénévole à la Croix-Rouge par conviction. Je suis psychologue. Ma pratique touche plutôt aux questions de l’enfance. Je n’étais pas familière des situations de stress et/ou post-traumatiques. Je voulais apprendre. Je voulais comprendre. Je voulais apporter ma pierre à l’édifice. L’écoute est la base de la psychologie de crise. Surtout par téléphone. On ne peut pas s’appuyer sur un regard, proposer un sourire ou tenter un geste, même lointain. Ici, il n’y a que la voix. Dans notre monde saturé d’informations visuelles, on sous-estime souvent le son. Mais c’est un vecteur puissant. Pour ne plus voir, il suffit de fermer les yeux. On ne peut pas fermer les oreilles. Le son est partout, tout le temps. Au SISU, la voix est notre outil. Autant pour comprendre à qui on s’adresse que pour déterminer l’environnement dans lequel on se trouve.
Mon jeune papa se juge mauvais père, mauvais compagnon, mauvais tout court. Son angoisse est telle que ses paroles lui brûlent la gorge. Derrière les mots, les émotions. Il est fatigué, anxieux, désemparé. Il étouffe. Il voudrait sortir sans anticiper tous les dangers de contamination qui guettent son fils. Il voudrait hurler. Peu à peu, je remonte avec lui le fil de ses habitudes. Les choses qu’il connaît et qui lui font du bien. Nous avons tous des ressources en nous pour calmer nos émotions négatives. La cuisine, le sport, la musique classique, les massages, je tisse le lien qui le relie à des jolis souvenirs, à toutes ses réussites infimes et quotidiennes qui composent la vie d’un parent… Quelques heures plus tard, il rappellera. Il a fait un long massage à son fils. Le petit s’est endormi en dix minutes. Et le papa aussi.
Alors que je viens de raccrocher, je vois mon collègue qui est en ligne. Il me fait un petit signe : tout va bien ? Je lui renvoie un clin d’œil : oui, ça va. Il sourit légèrement et se concentre sur son appel.
Plus jamais ça. J’ai cinquante ans, une belle carrière d’ingénieur derrière moi et ce que je considérais alors comme une vie heureuse. C’est une crise cardiaque qui tout a changé. Celle de mon voisin. Il y a un an, il est mort dans mes bras. Je me suis promis : plus jamais ça. J’ai commencé à la Croix-Rouge par le secourisme. En intervention, la victime est prise en charge et, une fois dans l’ambulance, ce sont les proches qui restent démunis, seuls avec leurs émotions. La petite musique du <em>« plus jamais ça »</em> a recommencé à tinter. Je me suis porté volontaire au SISU. Je décroche le téléphone. C’est une femme. Elle veut savoir si elle est folle…
D’abord, si je puis me permettre, je vais donner un conseil d’ordre général. Il faut arrêter de regarder les chaînes et les sites d’infos en continu. C’est l’hystérie. N’importe qui deviendrait fou. Au départ du confinement, je ne vais pas nier que j’ai ressenti une sérieuse montée d’adrénaline. Mais aujourd’hui sur le terrain l’ambiance est sereine. Il n’y a pas de horde de malades qui déferle sur les hôpitaux et au SISU le téléphone sonne, modérément. Une bonne nouvelle à partager sans modération sur votre réseau social préféré. D’ailleurs, c’est un challenge pour nous. Il faut rester concentré, disponibles, malgré de longues périodes de latence. Mes amis diraient que je suis d’un naturel optimiste. Ce n’est pas faux. Mais je suis aussi un matheux. Je suis avant tout réaliste.
J’écoute la jeune femme qui souffre d’être isolée sur son lieu de travail. Elle trouve que son employeur ne prend pas assez au sérieux les mesures de sécurité. Il semblerait qu’elle est la seule à s’en préoccuper. Selon ses termes, elle n’est ni <em>« germaphobe »</em> ni <em>« control freak ».</em> Elle supporte très difficilement d’être jugée associable et traitée comme une pestiférée. C’est le comble. Elle se sent seule contre tous. D’où sa question légitime : elle est folle ou ce sont les autres qui sont fous ?
Je suis aussi angoissé par l’épidémie. C’est difficile à gérer. Surtout quand on est isolé. Physiquement, psychologiquement ou socialement d’ailleurs, c’est égal. On ne sait pas combien de temps ça va durer. Il y a de quoi être stressé. Alors si elle est folle de se préoccuper des règles de sécurité, je le suis aussi. On est au moins deux. Et généralement, quand il y a deux fous dans la pièce, ils finissent par bien s’entendre.",Croix Rouge de Belgique,BE,French,fr,SISU,,,,"Generally, when there are two fools in the room, they end up getting along","Each case is different. Since the beginning of the epidemic, <a href=""https://www.croix-rouge.be/2020/04/03/coronavirus-appels-sisu/""> the federal call center receives eleven thousand calls day. Us, it is the second line, the Sisu: <b> S </b> ervice <b> I </b> ntervention Psycho- <b> S </b> ocial <b> U </b> rgente of the Red Cross. </a> It takes calls related to issues <em> ""shrink"" </em>. With each new decision of the National Security Council, there is growing concern. It's case by case.
I'm online with Dad. His four year old son wakes up twice a night. It makes tantrums as ever, despite its maximum availability. He scoured all yoga videos for children on Instagram and Pinterest all post to build a castle of the Snow Queen with rolls of toilet paper and tins of sardines. Twenty stories a day, a treasure hunt, third huts in the lounge and forty-four design workshops later, for him, containment is not an opportunity for a deep inner search and the best time to (re) read the four thousand pages <em> of in search of lost time </em> written by the most famous authors confined, but a domestic prison! It does not stop to yell with his partner. They can not be painting. This morning, he found the arms of his son covered with eczema. In the exhaustion and stress, is now adding helplessness and guilt.
I became a volunteer for the Red Cross conviction. I am a psychologist. My practice rather touches on issues of childhood. I was not familiar situations of stress and /or post-traumatic stress.

Les idées reçues. Les sans-abris, les jeunes, ça ne veut rien dire. C’est aussi précis et juste que « les gens ». Mais je ne jette pas la pierre. J’ai 25 ans. J’ai mes diplômes, mon permis de conduire, quelques lettres de recommandations et je viens d’une famille sans histoire. Quand j’ai commencé au centre d’accueil pour les sans-abris de la Croix-Rouge rue de Trêves, j’ai dû dépasser mes propres clichés. Un sans-abri ce n’est pas le type hirsute et aviné qui hurle à qui veut l’entendre que l’apocalypse approche en tirant un barda hétéroclite de sacs plastiques douteux. Et un jeune, ce n’est pas un mollusque décérébré avide de sensation et de divertissement facile qui passe d’une « lockdown party » à une autre en période de confinement. Je ne dis pas que ça n’existe pas. Je dis qu’il faut déconstruire les idées reçues, pandémie ou pas.
Quand j’ai postulé à la Croix-Rouge, je vais être honnête je ne savais pas trop où j’allais. Comme tous les jeunes, je cherchais avant tout un travail. Et l’an deux mille, ce n’est pas les sixties. Il y a moins d’offres que de demandes. Par contre, je me retrouvais complètement dans leurs valeurs. Engagement, bienveillance, diversité, coopération. Je ne dis pas que c’était ma ligne de conduite personnelle. Ce serait présomptueux. Mais je ne sais pas, ça m’a vraiment parlé, comme un genre d’idéal. C’est une chance. On rêve tous d’avoir un travail en accord avec nos valeurs. Ce que je lis dans la presse sur la question des sans-abris ne me satisfait pas. Les titres du genre : comment tu te laves les mains dix fois par jour quand ta source d’eau c’est le caniveau ? Comment tu restes à la maison quand tu n’en as pas ? Je ne dis pas que c’est malveillant ou même faux. Mais au mieux, cela ne correspond pas à la réalité du centre d’accueil. Au pire, cela véhicule les idées reçues.
L’épidémie a touché le centre de la Croix-Rouge pour l’accueil des sans-abris comme elle a touché le reste du pays. Comme tout le monde, on a traversé une période de sidération. Comme tout le monde on a mis un peu de temps à réaliser ce que ça voulait dire de revoir toutes nos habitudes. Comme tout le monde, on a annulé tout ce qu’on avait prévu dans les prochains mois. Comme tout le monde, on s’ennuie ferme. Comme ailleurs, une maman me dit qu’elle n’en peut plus de dormir, se réveiller, dormir, se réveiller et de perdre la notion du temps. Résidents comme personnels, on a pris conscience de la situation par palier. On respecte le marquage au sol dans le restaurant collectif, l’univers se réduit souvent à sa chambre et les enfants ne vont plus à l’école. On applique les règles. La responsabilité de chacun est engagée, comme partout. Ma famille me demande souvent si j’ai peur d’être contaminée, vu « les gens » avec qui je travaille. Mais le centre n’est pas un hôpital. J’ai peur de prendre l’avion, j’ai peur de ne pas donner la bonne réponse quand on me pose une question intime, j’ai peur de rougir en public, j’ai peur de grossir. Mais je n’ai pas peur de faire mon métier. Pourquoi ? Parce c’est comme être confiné en famille. On est juste une famille de deux cent cinquante.
Je dis souvent que le centre est un village dans la ville. C’est un peu cliché, d’accord. Mais celui là je l’aime bien. La vie en communauté a des avantages qui contiennent ses inconvénients. La distanciation sociale est un concept abstrait dans un espace communautaire. On a dû sensibiliser en accéléré pour faire face au virus. Mais les fondamentaux n’ont pas changé. C’est toujours aussi dur de voir partir un résident sans solution, de le voir s’éloigner pour une traversée en solitaire dans la tempête du monde. C’est toujours aussi dur d’accueillir des familles qui n’ont plus aucun repère. Déjà qu’en temps normal, on a tendance à détourner le regard des sans-abris, maintenant qu’on est tous enfermés chez soi, j’ai peur qu’on ne les oublie totalement.

Elle a quatre-vingts ans et elle vit seule depuis 16 ans, l’âge de ma plus jeune fille. On croit qu’on peut imaginer ce que c’est de vieillir. Mais non, on ne peut pas. Les contours de sa vie qui s’effacent peu à peu. Les enfants, quand on en a, qui sont loin, qui tracent leur chemin. L’amour d’une vie qui s’éteint, un jour, comme ça. Les amis qui s’en vont, doucement, l’un après l’autre. Les jours qui se répètent. Son propre reflet qu’on ne reconnaît plus vraiment. Marise dit souvent qu’elle n’arrive pas à croire que c’est elle la petite pomme fripée qu’elle voit dans la glace. Il ne reste que les souvenirs, le silence et l’indifférence du monde quand on <em>« ne sert plus à rien »</em>. C’est ce que m’a dit Marise quand je l’ai rencontrée il y a deux ans : <em>« Je ne sers plus à rien. À quoi bon respirer ? Je prends l’air des autres »</em>. Marise avait pratiquement arrêté de manger.
D’où je viens ce n’est pas pareil. Je suis italienne. On vit ensemble les vieux et les jeunes. Je pense que c’est pour ça que l’Italie est la plus touchée par le coronavirus. C’est vraiment injuste. Marise m’a dit : <em>« c’est pour ça que tu es bénévole pour la Croix-Rouge, c’est dans ta culture »</em>. Ce n’est pas grand chose une visite par semaine, on discute, on prend un café, on fait une balade ou des petites courses… Pourtant, je suis bien occupée. J’ai cinquante-deux ans, je suis aide-soignante dans une maison de repos et j’ai encore ma cadette qui vit à la maison. Je vais être honnête. Je crois que Marise se trompe. En fait, j’ai plus d’affinité avec les gens entre cinquante et septante ans. Pour nous, le temps n’a pas changé. Avec les quarante, trente-cinq, je me sens déconnectée. <em>« Tu es une jeune antiquité »</em>, me dit souvent Marise en riant.
Marise a beaucoup d’esprit parce qu’elle joue au Scrabble. J’en suis sûre. J’ai beaucoup appris avec elle. Je n’ai pas perdu mon accent, mais je suis beaucoup plus à l’aise en français. Le Scrabble pour Marise c’est sérieux. Elle n’aime pas trop perdre. Avec moi, aucune chance, c’est sans danger. Quand j’ai rencontré Marise, elle venait de perdre Francis. Son ami de toujours. Francis avait une voiture. Ils sortaient tous les mardi. Ils allaient au concert, au cinéma. Et puis, un jour il est parti. Pour nous, c’est juste une sortie annulée. Mais pour elle, c’était la sortie. Le moment vers lequel toute la semaine était tournée. C’était un peu le coronavirus en avance.
On pourrait se dire que le confinement n’a pas changé grand chose pour les personnes dans la situation de Marise. C’est l’inverse. L’histoire se répète. Mes coups de téléphone sont le dernier lien humain. Cela semble anodin, mais c’est une nécessité vitale. Je lui dépose dès que je peux une petite boîte des bonbons qu’elle adore dans sa boîte aux lettres, un article, un mot-croisé. Mais je ne peux plus lui rendre visite pour des raisons évidentes de sécurité. Annulées mes visites, fini le Scrabble, comme le cinéma et les concerts d’avant. Le mardi est redevenu un jour comme les autres. De l’extérieur, l’épidémie n’a pas changé grand chose, mais à l’intérieur elle a tout changé. En plus de la solitude habituelle, il y a maintenant la peur. <em>« S’il m’arrive quelque chose, personne ne s’en rendra compte »</em> me dit Marise au téléphone avec une voix étrange. Peur du vide. Peur du rayon vide au supermarché quand seules les habitudes peuvent rassurer. Peur du jugement des gens parce qu’elle n’a pas trouvé de masque de protection à la pharmacie alors qu’elle n’y peut rien. Peur des gestes quotidiens qui peuvent cacher la mort.
Avec Marise, le courant est passé tout de suite. Aujourd’hui, elle est devenue une amie. J’ai mal pour elle. J’ai peur pour elle. Avant de raccrocher, je lui dis : la vie continue. Et je l’entends sourire à l’autre bout du fil. La vie continue.",Croix Rouge de Belgique,BE,French,fr,SISU,,,,My phone calls are the last human link,"<Em> ""Isolation is my life"" </em>, said Marise the phone to reassure me. She is eighty years old and lives alone for 16 years, the age of my youngest daughter. You think you can imagine what it is to grow old. But no, you can not. The contours of his life that fade gradually. Children, when we have that are far away, who trace their path. The love of a life that goes out one day like this. Friends who are leaving, slowly, one after the other. The days that are repeated. His own reflection we do not really recognize. Marise often said she did not believe she's the little apple wrinkled she sees in the mirror. There are only memories, silence and indifference of the world when you <em> ""no longer good for nothing"" </em>. This is what said Marise when I met her two years ago: <em> ""I serve in anything. What good breathing? I take the air of others ""</em>. Marise had practically stopped eating.
Where I come from it's different. I am Italian. We live together the old and the young. I think that's why Italy is most affected by the coronavirus. It's really unfair. Marise said: <em> ""This is why you're a volunteer for the Red Cross, it is in your culture '</em>. It's not much one visit per week, we discuss, we have coffee, we took a walk or short strokes ... But I'm busy. I am fifty-two years, I am a nursing assistant in a nursing home and I still have my younger living at home. I'll be honest. I think Marise is mistaken. In fact, I have more affinity with people between fifty and seventy years. For us, time has not changed. With forty, thirty-five, I feel disconnected. <Em> ""You're a young antiquity"" </em>, said Marise often laughing.
Marise has a lot of spirit because it plays Scrabble. I am sure. I learned a lot with it. I have not lost my accent, but I'm much more comfortable in French. Scrabble for Marise is serious. She does not like to lose. With me, no chance, it is safe. When I met Marise, she had lost Francis. His lifelong friend. Francis had a car. They went out every Tuesday. They went to concerts, cinema. And then one day he left. For us, it's just a canceled output. But for her, it was the exit. The time to which all week was turned. It was a bit coronavirus in advance.
One might say that the containment has not changed much for those in the position of Marise. It's the opposite. The story repeats itself. My phone calls are the last human link. This seems trivial, but it is a vital necessity. I put him as soon as I can a little box of candy that she loves in her mailbox, an article, a crossword. But I can not visit him for obvious security reasons. Canceled my visits ended Scrabble, like cinema and avant concerts. Tuesday is again a day like any other. From the outside, the epidemic has not changed much, but inside it has all changed. In addition to the usual loneliness, there is now fear. <Em> ""If anything happens to me, no one will report"" </em> says Marise the phone with a strange voice. Fear of heights. Fear of empty shelf in the supermarket when only habits can reassure. Fear of judgment people because it has not found a protective mask at the pharmacy while she can do nothing. Fear of everyday actions that can hide death.
Marise, the current is passed immediately. Today she has become a friend. I ache for her. I'm afraid for her. Before hanging up, I said, life goes on. And I hear smile at the other end. Life goes on.","<Em> ""Isolation is my life"" </ em>, said Marise the phone to reassure me. She is eighty years old and lives alone for 16 years, the age of my youngest daughter.

Tu appliques le protocole. Je suis préparé. Je suis formé. Pas besoin de réfléchir. Tu réponds à l’appel. Tu t’équipes. Tu vérifies les paramètres. Niveau de température. Pourcentage d’oxygène. Tu prends en charge le malade. Le chauffeur reste au volant. Tu limites au maximum les contacts. Tu installes le patient dans l’ambulance. Le chauffeur roule. On va vite. Mais il contrôle. C’est une question de balance. L’urgence c’est la maîtrise. Rien d’autre. Mon formateur l’a répété mille fois. Je n’ai jamais oublié. Tu arrives à l’hôpital. Tu transmets le patient. Tu enlèves ta combinaison. Tu la mets dans un sac pour destruction. Tu repars. Tu rentres au poste de secours de la Croix-Rouge. Désinfection totale de l’ambulance. Tu branches le brumisateur. On dirait un scarabée l’engin. Pulvérisation de millions de microgouttelettes de peroxyde. Le virus n’a aucune chance.
Combien de temps ça va durer ? Je ne me pose pas la question. Ma fille, bien. Combien de temps ? Je ne sais pas mon petit chat. Au début on avait une sortie par jour pour le covid. Suspicion de contamination. C’est le terme. Nous on ne teste pas. On répond. On embraye. Il est deux heures du matin. On a déjà fait trois sorties. Avant de se coucher, ma petite m’a montré sa poupée. Barbie corona elle m’a dit. J’ai halluciné. Elle lui avait mis un masque avec un bandana. Elle est géniale pour ça. Elle exprime tout. Ce week-end quand on applaudissait dans la rue, elle m’a dit « on dirait la coupe du monde ». Pauvre chou. J’en aurais pleuré. Drôle de génération. J’espère que ça ne va pas trop leur laisser de marques.
Des opérations, j’en ai fait. La douleur physique ne me touche pas. Pas parce que je suis insensible. Je fais ce métier pour sauver des vies. La souffrance ne me laisse pas indifférent. Ce que je veux dire c’est que je peux contrôler mes émotions. Parce que je sais comment répondre à la douleur. Je sais quoi faire. Formation. Préparation. J’applique le protocole. C’est comme ça qu’on sauve des vies. Si tu te poses trop de questions, si tu hésites, si tu cherches tes gestes, tu ne peux pas sauver une vie. Mais la détresse psychologique, c’est autre chose. Quand c’est dans la tête. C’est dur.
J’aime les tournées nocturnes. Le temps passe autrement. L’espace semble différent. Mon ambulance est une lumière dans la nuit. Avant le covid, je le faisais sur mon temps libre. Maintenant, je suis à temps plein. On attend la vague qui monte. Les pourcentages sont de notre côté. Je m’accroche aux chiffres. C’est du tangible. C’est concret. Il faut que les gens arrêtent d’aller aux urgences. Il ne faut pas paniquer. Il faut rester rationnel. Pas évident. Le virus se moque de nos idées, de nos inquiétudes, des nos sentiments. Il en veut à notre souffle de vie.
Le malade qu’on a amené n’est pas bien. On arrive à l’hôpital. Je vois la tente de la Croix-Rouge. Il y a du monde. Trop de monde ? Je croise le regard d’un volontaire. Pas le temps de parler. Le patient. Un homme. Cinquante-deux ans. Pas d’antécédents médicaux. Toux. Maux de ventre. Douleur thoracique. L’oxygène dans ses poumons chute. Le médecin va sans doute le passer sous respirateur. L’homme pleure. Pas parce qu’il a peur. Pas pour lui. Parce qu’il est seul. Pour ses enfants. Je voudrais lui faire des promesses. Poser les pourcentages. Mais je ne peux pas. Je n’ai pas ce pouvoir. Je n’ai pas le droit. C’est dur.
Je suis fatigué. Il ne faut pas que ça rentre dans ma tête. Je pense à mon petit chat qui dort, sa poupée serrée contre elle, son souffle de vie qui fait gonfler son ventre rond. Je serais là pour le petit déjeuner. Le souvenir de son sourire efface tout.",Croix Rouge de Belgique,BE,French,fr,SISU,,,,My Ambulance is a light in the night,"For me it is simple.

217949,Son inquiétude lui donne une force de création incroyable,http://future-rcrc.com/testimonial/son-inquietude-lui-donne-une-force-de-creation-incroyable/,"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 13:47:49 +0000",http://future-rcrc.com/?post_type=wpm-testimonial&p=217949,"Je ne suis pas un héros. J’aurai 35 ans dans 4 jours. Ça ne doit pas être une bonne date le 23 mars. La dernière fois que je me suis dit ça c’était un certain 22 mars quand une bombe a explosé à Bruxelles. C’était la veille de mon anniversaire. Je ne suis pas un héros et quand je me suis levé ce matin, je ne me sentais pas un héros. J’avais mal à tête, migraine chronique, la norme pour moi. Ma première pensée s’est focalisée sur mon père. Deux jours qu’il est seul chez lui. J’aimerais avoir le pouvoir de développer des anticorps pour lui apporter son journal qu’il lit tous les jours depuis quarante ans, et le serrer dans mes bras. Tout a basculé si vite. L’exceptionnel est devenu normal. Ce qui était banal est interdit. Les gestes auxquels on ne faisait pas attention dans notre quotidien sont devenus des gestes qui prennent des vies, ou qui en sauvent. C’est fou.  Je ne suis pas un héros parce que j’ai peur. Mais je me sens en même temps très calme. Est-ce que c’est ça, vivre au temps d’une pandémie ?
La tente de la Croix-Rouge installée devant l’hôpital Saint-Luc me donne le sentiment que le combat a vraiment commencé et qu’il va être âpre. C’est là que je vais. Je suis volontaire depuis cinq ans. Je me suis proposé pour faire le tri des patients. Je n’aime pas l’expression. Mais j’en comprends bien le sens impérieux. Il faut que les urgences puissent fonctionner sans que le virus ne contamine l’hôpital. Ils nous ont appelé pour qu’on les aide à orienter les gens. Mon traducteur mental me fait comprendre qu’on doit protéger les équipes médicales et rassurer la population. Quand je me suis engagé avec la Croix-Rouge de Belgique c’était pour aider les plus vulnérables. Aujourd’hui, ce sont les médecins les plus vulnérables. Je me dis un instant que c’est absurde. Pas longtemps. Je sais que c’est la réalité qui a changé. Le virus fait bouger toutes les lignes. Ils nous obligent à réinventer nos rôles, à repenser la hiérarchie des priorités. Je n’ai pas dit à mon père ce que je faisais aujourd’hui. Je ne voulais pas l’inquiéter. C’est une vraie mère-poule.
Le temps d’enfiler mon masque, mes lunettes de protection, une sur-blouse et je suis en première ligne. Pourtant l’ambiance dans la tente est plutôt détendue, au vu des circonstances. Le bénévole que je remplace, un chouette gars, même si on n’a pas les mêmes goûts musicaux et que ça nous a valu quelques belles embardées, me dit qu’ils ont déjà reçu quatre-vingt personnes. Il précise que la plupart ont pu rentrer chez eux. Mon visage doit trahir mes pensées. Est-ce qu’il essaye de me rassurer ? Pourquoi ? J’ai l’air nerveux ? Je me sens toujours aussi calme.
L’épreuve du feu commence pour moi par une femme et son fils de douze ans. Il a des frissons et il a vomi ce matin me dit sa maman. Je leur fournis un masque chacun et du gel hydro-alcoolique. Je vois qu’elle fait un effort surhumain pour rassurer son fils. Elle me fait penser à Roberto Benigni  dans « La vie est belle ». Elle transforme le test en jeu. Son inquiétude lui donne une force de création incroyable. Je me sens de moins en moins un héros, mais elle, je la vois comme une vraie héroïne. Bigger than life. Décidemment, la réalité rattrape la fiction depuis quelques jours. Alors je m’en remets aux gestes que je connais. Tout ce que j’ai appris pendant mes maraudes pour les sans-abris me revient de manière instinctive. Mais comment rassurer quand on est habillé comme un virologue de science fiction ? Comment montrer son sourire avec un masque sur la bouche ? Comment faire passer par les mains ce que les mots ne disent pas, quand nos doigts sont isolés par des gants en latex ?
Je commence le questionnaire avec une appréhension que j’espère imperceptible. Séjour à l’étranger ? Contact avec une personne contaminée ? La mère opine. Je sens un fil qui se noue dans mon ventre. Leur destin peut basculer dans une file ou l’autre. Les covid-19 ou… Les autres. Toux, fièvre, température ? La mère fait non de la tête. Négatif ! J’ai presque crié en le disant. La maman se confond en excuse. Elle aurait dû penser à un bête rhume ou une vilaine grippe, mais avec tous ces fils d’actualité, elle a perdu le contrôle. Benigni a retiré son masque de clown triste pour laisser apparaître une maman à bout de nerf. Elle aurait dû… Je l’applaudis. Je ne sais pas ce qu’il me prend, mais je l’applaudis. Puisque je ne peux pas vraiment sourire, pas vraiment poser la main sur son bras, je l’applaudis pour lui dire qu’elle a bien fait, qu’on est là pour ça et que tout va bien aller. Dehors, on entend applaudir. Le garçon retrouve le sourire. Les clap-clap se propagent plus vite que le virus.
Alors que la journée va s’achever pour moi après un shift de huit heures, la stridulation angoissante d’une sirène d’ambulance s’approche très vite de nous. Je sors. C’est une ambulance de la Croix-Rouge. Eux aussi sont sur le front. Le brancard surgit par les portes. Le patient est intubé, sous assistance respiratoire. Je croise le regard de l’ambulancier qui n’a pas le temps de me donner son diagnostic…",Croix Rouge de Belgique,BE,French,fr,SISU,,,,His concern gives it an incredible creative force,"I am not a hero.

I'm not a hero because I'm afraid. But I feel at the same time very quiet. Does that's it, live in the time of a pandemic?
The tent of the Red Cross installed in front of the Saint-Luc hospital gives me the feeling that the battle really began and it will be bitter. This is where I go. I volunteer for five years. I volunteered to sort patients. I do not like the expression. But I understand the compelling sense. Must emergencies can operate without the virus infects the hospital. They called us to be helped to direct people. My mind translator me understand that we must protect medical teams and reassure the population.

I did not want to worry her. This is a real mother hen.

The volunteer that I replace a guy owl, although it has different musical tastes and it has earned us some beautiful swerving, said they have already received eighty people. He said most were able to return home. My face must betray my thoughts. Is he trying to reassure me? Why ? I look nervous? I always feel as calm.
The fireproof begins to me by a woman and her twelve year old son. He shivers and he vomited this morning told me his mom. I provide them each a mask and freezing hydro-alcoholic. I see she made a superhuman effort to reassure his son. It reminds me of Roberto Benigni in ""Life is Beautiful"". It transforms the test in. Her anxiety gives him an incredible creative force. I feel less and less a hero, but I see it as a real heroine. Bigger than life. Decidedly, reality catches up with fiction for a few days. So I leave it to the gestures I know. Everything I have learned during my marauding for the homeless back to me instinctively. But how reassuring when you're dressed like a virologist science fiction?

Their fate can swing in a queue or the other. The Covid-19 ... or the other. Cough, fever, temperature? The mother shakes her head. Negative! I almost screamed in the saying. Mom merges apologize. She should think of a beast nasty cold or flu, but with all these current son she lost control. Benigni removed his sad clown mask to reveal a nerve end to mom. She should have ... I applaud. I do not know what it takes, but I applaud him. Since I can not really smile, not really put a hand on his arm, I applaud to say she did well, we're here for and that everything will go well.

Her worry gives her incredible creative strength. I feel less and less a hero, but she, I see her as a real heroine. Bigger than life. Really, reality has caught up with fiction for a few days. So I rely on the gestures that I know. Everything I learned during my homeless raids comes back to me instinctively. But how can you reassure when you are dressed like a science fiction virologist?

Nos han pedido que contestemos en 2/4 líneas, pero simplemente, me resulta imposible. Creo que ante esta situación, que ha sido tan inesperada para todos ¿Quién se hubiera imaginado nunca, que un virus así, un enemigo tan nuevo como desconocido, paralizase el mundo de semejante manera? Qué haya conseguido vaciar de gente, las principales arterias, de las ciudades más importantes del mundo. Tanto es así, que ha obligado a la mayoría de estudiantes y trabajadores, a cesar en sus obligaciones, y quedarse encerrados entre cuatro paredes. Ante la soledad, ante el miedo, ante el peligro, ante la desesperanza de muchas personas, que van a atravesar esta difícil temporada solos, sobre todo, nuestros mayores, que muchos están en sus casas, sin nadie que los acompañe, y sin poder a penas salir, por ser eso que hemos bautizado como, población de riesgo. Y creo que eso realmente, es muy duro, y muy triste. A mí, como estudiante de TES (Técnico en Emergencias Sanitarias), me ha dejado sin prácticas, y en mi casa.
Por eso, yo, tuve claro desde el principio, como voluntaria de Cruz Roja Española en León, dentro de Socorros y Emergencias, que no podía estar de brazos cruzados sin hacer nada. Que a pesar de ese inevitable, pero atajante miedo, aún a riesgo del contagio, he querido ayudar y aportar mi pequeño grano de arena a esta situación. Abordando así, las dificultades de ese colectivo tan vulnerable. Acercándoles alimentos, medicinas, o conversando con ellos por teléfono, porqué quizá, sea la única comunicación que tengan con el exterior. Durante estos días, he visto y oído situaciones realmente difíciles, duras, muy duras. También he visto caras de alegría, esa alegría con la que te reciben, que abren la puerta y te agradecen una y otra vez la labor que realizamos, y verdaderamente, eso no está pagado. Creo que en muchas ocasiones, no somos conscientes de la suerte que tenemos de tener una vivienda digna, y algo que llevarnos a la boca. Con esto, no busco un reconocimiento, no busco ese aplauso, lo hago altruistamente, porque realmente me gusta, siempre que me sea posible, ayudar a la humanidad, será para mí un absoluto placer, no quiere decir con ello, que no esté orgullosa de mi trabajo, porque si lo estoy, mucho. Y si después de esto, no somos mejores personas, realmente no habremos aprendido nada de esta pandemia.

Cuéntanos tu historia </b>
Nunca había tenido el placer de hacer voluntariado por falta de tiempo. Estos días me he dado cuenta de que cuando acabe todo esto quiero seguir ayudando en la Cruz Roja.
El miércoles fui a la centralita a hacer llamadas a los socios de la Cruz Roja, la mayoría personas mayores. Les recordé las medidas preventivas y pregunté cómo se encontraban, si necesitaban algo. Todos fueron muy amables conmigo y me gustó mucho poder ayudar, ya que algunos tenían dudas y otros distintas necesidades. Si es verdad que me dió mucha pena darme cuenta de que siempre nos olvidamos de las personas mayores y creo que deberíamos cuidarles más de lo que lo hacemos.
El viernes fui a hacer lotes de comida para personas necesitadas. También fue una satisfacción poder ayudar en ese aspecto. Me sentí que por fin podía aportar mi granito de arena.
Además los demás voluntarios son muy agradables y muy simpáticos y me ayudaron en todo momento.
<b> ¿Cómo ha cambiado el brote de coronavirus tu vida diaria?</b>
Soy estudiante por lo que tampoco ha cambiado mucho a nivel de rutina, lo único que en vez de ir a la biblioteca estudio y hago los trabajos en casa.
Mentalmente si me ha cambiado mucho, me he dado cuenta que siendo que soy una persona joven puedo aportar mucho en la sociedad, por lo que me encantaría poder seguir ayudando en la Cruz Roja.
<b> ¿Qué has aprendido del brote de coronavirus?</b>
El ser humano somos una especie igual de vulnerable que cualquier otra especie y nos creemos invencibles. Esto me ha ayudado a ver que tenemos que ser menos egoístas, tanto con la sociedad en general cómo con el medio ambiente.
También me he dado cuenta de que la gente es capaz de sacar su lado más solidario y eso me hace muy feliz.
Espero que no se nos olvide nunca.
<b> En el contexto de Coronavirus, ¿qué has hecho que te enorgullece?</b>
Poder ayudar a las personas mayores y a las más desfavorecidas
<b> Como persona voluntaria, ¿cuál es el principal desafío durante este brote de Covid-19?</b>
La parte emocional yo creo, muchas personas a las que he llamado están solas en sus casas y me dan mucha pena porque a alguna la he notado tristona y eso pues te llega.
<b> ¿Qué has visto por primera vez debido a Covid-19?</b>
Nada en especial
<b>¿Cómo crees que el ánimo y la esperanza pueden aumentar a través de nuestra respuesta al coronavirus?</b><b> </b>

I never had the pleasure of volunteering for lack of time. These days I've noticed that when this is all over I want to continue helping the Red Cross.
Wednesday went to the switchboard to make calls to members of the Red Cross, most elderly. I reminded preventive measures and asked how they were, if they needed anything. They were all very kind to me and I really enjoyed being able to help, as some had doubts and other various needs. If it is true that I was very sorry to realize that we always forget the elderly and I think we should take care of them more than we do.
On Friday I went to lots of food to people in need. It was also a pleasure to help in that regard. I felt I could finally contribute my grain of sand.

I am a student so it has not changed much routine level, the only thing instead of going to the library study and do work at home.
Mentally if it has changed me a lot, I realized that since I am a young person can contribute much in society, so I would love to continue helping the Red Cross.
<B> What have you learned from the outbreak of coronavirus? </B>
Human beings are equal vulnerable species than any other species and we believe invincible. This has helped me to see that we have to be less selfish, both society in general and the environment.
I have also noticed that people are able to get his caring side and that makes me very happy.
I hope we never forget not.

To help the elderly and the most disadvantaged
<B> As a volunteer, what is the main challenge during this outbreak Covid-19? </B>
The emotional part I think, many people who have called are alone in their homes and give me some very sad because I have noticed sadder and that as it comes.

Nothing special
<B> How do you think the mood and hope can raise through our response to the coronavirus? </B> <b> </b>

I never had the pleasure of volunteering for lack of time. These days I've noticed that when this is all over I want to continue helping the Red Cross.
Wednesday I went to the switchboard to make calls to members of the Red Cross, most elderly. I reminded them of preventive measures and asked how they were, if they needed anything. They were all very kind to me and I really enjoyed being able to help, as some had doubts and other various needs. It is true that I was very sorry to realize that we always forget the elderly and I think we should take care of them more than we do.
On Friday I went to prepare food for people in need. It was also a pleasure to help in that regard. I felt I could finally contribute my grain of sand.
Also the other volunteers are very nice and very friendly and helped me at all times.
<B> How has the outbreak of coronavirus your daily life? </B>
I am a student so it has not changed much routine level, the only thing is that instead of going to the library I study and do work at home.
Mentally it has changed me a lot, I realized that since I am a young person I can contribute much in society, so I would love to continue helping the Red Cross.
<B> What have you learned from the outbreak of coronavirus? </B>
Human beings are just as vulnerable a species as any other species and we believe ourselves invincible. This has helped me to see that we have to be less selfish, both society in general and the environment.
I have also noticed that people are able to bring out their caring side and that makes me very happy.
I hope we never forget.

Hola, me llamo Elena, tengo 23 años y pertenezco a Cruz roja La Bañeza. He participado tanto en la entrega de lotes de comida y medicamentos, como en llamadas a personas mayores.
<b>¿Cómo ha cambiado el brote de coronavirus tu vida diaria?</b>
Pues es difícil. Teletrabajo y estoy en la universidad. Las clases y entregas son telemáticas, lo cual dificulta el aprendizaje. Tengo muchos allegados de la rama sanitaria y lo están pasando muy mal. Además de todos los amigos que han perdido a familiares.
<b>¿Qué has aprendido del brote de coronavirus?</b>
Qué hay dos formas de actuar. Una es la de los altos cargos políticos, que solo miran por su propio interés, por lucrarse, haciéndose todos los test del mundo, cuando mucha gente en los hospitales, no pueden optar a ellos. Compran a los medios de comunicación, ocultan datos, y no facilitan recursos a los sanitarios.
Pero a pesar de ello, sigue habiendo mucha gente buena en el mundo. En concreto, aquí en La Bañeza, mucha gente se ha implicado. Ya sea en su trabajo, con asociaciones como Cruz roja, protección civil... O como particulares que estamos cosiendo mascarillas en nuestras casas... Si hay algo bonito en todo esto, es sin duda alguna, la unión y solidaridad que ha creado.
<b>En el contexto de Coronavirus, ¿qué has hecho que te enorgullece?</b>
Cada vez que hablo con un señor mayor y está triste y al final de la llamada noto que le he animado. También la cara de gratitud de la gente a la que le entregamos los alimentos.
<b>Como persona voluntaria, ¿cuál es el principal desafío durante este brote de Covid-19?</b>
El miedo a salir de casa, pero tienes que pensar que hay personas que lo necesitan y eso te da fuerzas para hacerlo.
<b>¿Qué has visto por primera vez debido a Covid-19?</b>
Es muy duro cada vez que hablo con una persona mayor y me dicen que estan muy solos, que nadie les puede ir a ver.
Otro día, fuimos a llevar comida a una familia, y al dejarles las cajas en la puerta, un niño de unos 6 añitos dijo :""¡Mira mamá!, ¡¡Comida!!"". Como si fuese un gran regalo.
<b>¿Cómo crees que el ánimo y la esperanza pueden aumentar a través de nuestra respuesta al coronavirus?</b>

Hello, my name is Elena, I have 23 years and belong to the Red Cross La Bañeza. I participated both in delivering lots of food and medicines, and calls to seniors.
<B> How has the outbreak of coronavirus your daily life? </B>
Well, it's difficult. Telework and I'm in college. Classes and deliveries are telematics, which hinders learning. I have many relatives of the healthcare industry and they are going very badly. In addition to all the friends who have lost family members.
<B> What have you learned from the outbreak of coronavirus? </B>
There are two ways of acting. One is senior politicians, who look only for their own interest, make a profit, making all the world test, when many people in hospitals, not eligible for them. They buy the media, hide data, and do not provide resources to health.
But nevertheless, there are still many good people in the world. Specifically, here in La Bañeza, many people have been involved. Whether at work, with associations such as Red Cross, civil defense ... Or as individuals who are sewing masks in our houses ... If there is something nice in all this is without doubt the unity and solidarity that created .

Every time I talk to an older man is sad and at the end of the call notice that I have encouraged. Also the face of gratitude from the people who deliver food.
<B> As a volunteer, what is the main challenge during this outbreak Covid-19? </B>
Fear of leaving home, but you have to think that there are people who need it and that gives you the strength.

It's very hard every time I talk to a person and tell me they are very lonely, no one can go see them.

Mi experiencia como presidenta y sobretodo voluntaria, es diferente, me he visto afectada por el Covid 19 y no he podido estar en primera linea ayudando, es algo frustrante.  Me han tenido que ayudar a mi.
La vida se ha parado radicalmente entre cuatro paredes.  Mi gran obsesión es proteger de mi a las personas con las que convivo y poder seguir ayudando, dentro de las limitaciones de mi situación a las personas.
Me enorgullece formar parte de esta GRAN Institución y sobretodo de los voluntarios de mi Asamblea y del resto de Asambleas, se están volcando.
El principal desafío es llegar a todas las personas vulnerables que lo necesitan, sobre todo a nuestros mayores. Que no se sientan solos. Es muy importante.
La parte positiva de esta situación, que aunque nos encontramos separados físicamente, estamos mas unidos que nunca. Las iniciativas individuales están ayudando. Por ej. En mi ciudad el Carnaval de Balcones durante dos semanas he visto por las redes sociales como las familias al completo han estado ocupadas y unidas para llegar al gran desfile final que es hoy dia 4 de abril.
La esperanza y el ánimo ya están, desde los aplausos de los balcones hasta el vecino que te ayuda trayendo la comida o simplemente llamándote por teléfono para que no te sientas tan solo. Sobre todo los aplausos a los profesionales que se encuentran en primerísima línea de batalla.

Hope and courage are already, from the applause of the balconies to the neighbor who helps bringing your food or just calling on the phone so you do not feel so alone. Especially the applause professionals who are in first line of battle.

I have also collaborated on ""You have my help"" which is a group of psychologists who offer our help to those who need it.

Mi día a día ha cambiado también a pesar de que ya estaba finalizando mis estudios a distancia. El hecho de no poder pasear cerca de casa o ir al monte un fin de semana nos hace valorar esos pequeños placeres que pasaban desapercibidos en nuestra ""vida anterior"". Pero si hay algo que cuesta y resulta duro es alejarnos de los amigos y familia. Situación que el subconsciente nos dice que terminará pronto pero la lógica y sentido común que queda mucho todavía.
Desde que soy voluntario en Cruz Roja, hace algo más de un año, mi intención es ayudar en lo posible a las personas que forman parte de colectivos en vulnerabilidad. Con la llegada de la pandemia no dudé en ofrecerme para colaborar en lo posible. Actualmente, junto con mis compañeros, nos encargamos del reparto de comida a domicilio para personas mayores y hacemos llamadas telefónicas para conocer su situación. Intentamos evitar así que salgan de casa y se expongan al contagio. Su amabilidad y agradecimiento son más que suficiente gratificación para seguir con nuestra misión.
Es un orgullo saber que la institución ha puesto en marcha la mayor movilización de su historia para hacer frente a esta crisis. Creo que todos hemos aprendido que con unidad y un objetivo común los seres humanos podemos hacer frente a cualquier adversidad y superarla. El principal desafío para mí, como voluntario de Cruz Roja, es que las personas a las que ayudamos y visitamos se mantengan sanas y en casa. Saber que nuestra labor es efectiva me hace sentir con ganas de seguir adelante y las fuerzas renovadas.
Al vernos por las calles con los distintivos de Cruz Roja la gente nos ve de forma distinta. En las tres semanas que llevo colaborarando, han sido varias las personas que desde sus ventanas nos agradecen y nos ayudan si nos ven algo perdidos. De alguna forma, creo que con nuestra aportación ofrecemos humildemente el camino a seguir en situaciones límite y si eso sirve para dar esperanza y ver la luz al final de este camino tan largo, nos llenaría de orgullo. Personalmente, me parece que en momentos tan duros como este que vivimos sale la mejor versión de todos, en muchos casos inédita, y eso se nota.  Por ejemplo en el vecino que se preocupa por tu salud o la admiración hacia aquellos antes olvidados, que trabajan por un sueldo precario pero de gran importancia en nuestra sociedad (sanitarios, limpiadores, cajeros o reponedores). Por todos ellos, mil aplausos nunca será suficientes.",Spanish Red Cross,ES,Spanish,es,Marlon,,,,To see us through the streets with the distinctive Red Cross people see us differently,"The situation we currently find it difficult to assimilate and unimaginable a few months ago. My daily life has changed even though it was already finishing my studies at a distance. The inability to walk close to home or go to the mountains for a weekend makes us appreciate the little pleasures that went unnoticed in our ""previous life"". But if something is difficult and it is hard to get away from friends and family. Situation that the subconscious tells us that over soon but logic and common sense that there is much yet.
Since I volunteer in Red Cross, a little over a year, my intention is to help as much as possible to people who are part of groups in vulnerability. With the arrival of the pandemic I did not hesitate to volunteer to collaborate wherever possible. Currently, together with my colleagues, we handle the distribution of food delivery for the elderly and make phone calls to know their status. So we try to avoid leaving home and being exposed to contagion. His kindness and gratitude are more than enough gratification to continue our mission.
It is proud to know that the institution has launched the largest mobilization in its history to deal with this crisis. I think we've all learned that with unity and common purpose humans can face any adversity and overcome it. The main challenge for me as a Red Cross volunteer, is that the people we serve and visited stay healthy and at home. Knowing that our work is effective I felt eager to go ahead and renewed forces.
To see us through the streets with the distinctive Red Cross people see us differently. In the three weeks that I colaborarando they have been several people who from their windows thank us and help us if we see something lost. Somehow, I think our contribution humbly offer the way forward in extreme situations and if that serves to give hope and see the light at the end of this long road, fill us with pride. Personally, I think that in such hard times like this that we live out the best version of all, in many cases unprecedented, and it shows. For example, in the neighbor who cares about your health or forgotten admiration before those who work for poor salaries but of great importance in our society (health, cleaners, cashiers and stockers).

Well, I think that all of us have learned to value little things more, family and friends. That at any time when you least expect it, your life changes 100% and suddenly all your plans go into the background.
In the context of Coronavirus, what have you done that makes you proud?
The simple fact of belonging to an Organization that is leaving the skin and soul for the most disadvantaged without thinking of oneself.
As a volunteer, what is the main challenge during this Covid-19 outbreak?
Well, the fear of not being able to respond to all disadvantaged people, that we miss something, do things well in general.
What have you seen for the first time since Covid-19?
A lot of fear, a lot of misinformation and a lot of loneliness, especially in older people.
How do you think the mood and hope can raise through our response to the coronavirus?
Being at the foot of the canyon as before, not fainting, for the most vulnerable and who feel that we are here for what they need and when they need it.",,Yes,,,None

Cuéntanos tu historia</b>
Mi experiencia personal como Presidente de la Asamblea ha sido ver el valor del voluntariado que tenemos en la Institución a los que he tenido que poner turnos para que no vengan todxs a la vez, ver esa gran corazón altruista del que hacemos gala, no preguntar para que se les envía a recoger, cargar, entregar, realizar llamadas y no escuchar nunca un no por respuesta.
<b>¿Cómo ha cambiado el brote de coronavirus tu vida diaria?</b>
Yo creo que como a todxs nos ha hecho cambiar nuestra forma diaria de comportarnos en materia de seguridad e higiene, valorar lo que tenemos alrededor, echar de menos los abrazos y tener aún más empatía.
<b>¿Qué has aprendido del brote de coronavirus?</b>
Lo fácil que es vencernos y la desorganización que tenemos a nuestro alrededor, con lo cual se aprende de los errores y a intentar “prepararnos para lo que venga”.
<b>En el contexto de Coronavirus, ¿qué has hecho que te enorgullece?</b>
Me enorgullece representar a la Institución con las personas que tengo a mí alrededor en el día a día.
<b>Como persona voluntaria, ¿cuál es el principal desafío durante este brote de Covid-19?</b>
El principal desafío que tenemos en nuestra provincia es llegar a las personas mayores, que además de ser los más vulnerables por sus edades, les sumamos la Pandemia y que la mayoría de ellos viven en pueblos alejados de grandes poblaciones.
<b>¿Qué has visto por primera vez debido a Covid-19?</b>
Miedo en las personas. Miedo a la pandemia, a perder los puestos de trabajo, a no tener que comer, a la falta de medicamentos, miedo en general a la vida normal y corriente que hasta ahora habíamos llevado.

Me siento muy muy orgulloso del trabajo que realizamos, de mis compañeros, de todas la personas que formamos Cruz Roja. Después de mis hijos y mi mujer, lo mejor que me ha pasado en la vida es pertenecer a esta organización.
El poder dar tu tiempo libre para ayudar a los demás es muy gratificante, te llena el corazón de sentimientos y valores que quizás antes no conocías, no tiene precio el ayudar a una persona, que cuando llegas tú a entregarle su medicación, solo con una mirada te da todo lo que tiene dentro, sabes con sus ojos lo agradecida que está. Eso no tiene precio.
También en el área de emergencias y socorros pasa lo mismo y he tenido la desgracia en preventivos de atender a personas que aun estando en situación complicada, no dejan de agradecerte lo que haces por ellas. Y me siento extraño cuando te lo agradecen por que creo que estamos para trabajar por ellos y no para que te den las gracias.

Trois semaines plus tard, la vision de la tente de la Croix-Rouge devant l’hôpital continue de me frapper. Vingt et un jours plus tard, notre mission d’orientation médicale est devenue familière, mais je ressens comme une inquiétante étrangeté. Pourtant, les nouvelles sont plutôt bonnes. Allez, disons, encourageantes. De notre côté, le dispositif est en place. Rien à voir avec le <em>rush</em> du début où il fallait former les équipes, roder les procédures, avancer à l’aveugle. Les bénévoles reste motivés. On est crevé, mais l’ambiance générale est bonne. Je suppose que, sans oser trop le dire à voix haute, dans un recoin de notre peur, on s’était tous plus ou moins imaginé un scénario à la <em>World War Z</em>, un délire de contamination hors-contrôle, hôpitaux débordés, course contre la montre avec un virus mutagène, scène de furie et combat de gladiateur dans les rayons surgelé des supermarchés. Bref, le monde connu qui part en torche. Et bien non. Au début du confinement, on a accueilli jusqu’à cent personnes par jour. La semaine dernière, on est redescendu à cinquante, trente certains jours. J’espère que la courbe s’aplatit. Un voile d’exception semble se poser comme un filet, léger et transparent, sur les rues, les parcs et l’hôpital. On encaisse le flux, mais la pression est là. Notre équipe de secouristes a intégré les murs. On est plus juste à l’entrée. On est dedans. C’est la première fois, à ma connaissance. On accueille les patients à la sortie de l’ambulance pour éviter que les brancardiers ne rentrent dans le bâtiment. On transfert vers le scanner et les unités de soin. En somme, on circule dans tout l’hôpital. J’appréhendais un peu. Pas comme un premier jour dans un nouveau boulot. C’est plus insidieux. Même si la demande venait de l’hôpital, je ne voulais pas qu’on gêne, qu’on marche sur les plates-bandes. C’est un monde en soi l’hôpital, avec ses règles officielles, mais aussi ses codes tacites. Il faut une bonne dose de savoir-être, quelques degrés d’intensité au dessus du savoir-vivre. Quand je disais que les nouvelles sont encourageantes, c’était plutôt à l’extérieur. Je ne vais pas verser dans le catastrophisme, on n’est pas débordé. Néanmoins, à l’intérieur de l’hôpital la tendance s’est inversée. Il y a plus d’examens lourds. On n’est jamais à l’abri d’une bonne nouvelle comme dirait mon père. Je n’avais jamais bien compris cette expression, même si elle me faisait sourire. Aujourd’hui, je vois ce qu’il voulait dire. Trois semaines que je n’ai pas pu le voir. Enfin si, mais sous la forme d’un coucou à la fenêtre. Je sais qu’il n’a pas une vision terrible. Je me demande s’il me voit à moitié flou. Ça me fait de la peine. C’est hallucinant. Ce virus réussit à renverser toutes nos bases. Il s’insinue dans le quotidien, les couples, les familles, en réécrivant le quotidien. Et nous, on s’adapte plus ou moins. On accepte la distance avec nos proches. Mais d’une manière résignée et méfiante. Comment puis-je me résigner à me méfier de mon père ? À me méfier pour lui, de moi. Je sais que c’est pareil pour tout le monde. Éloignement me paraît plus juste que confinement. Et je ne sais pas, c’est une souffrance légère et transparente, comme un voile. Alors non, l’épidémie n’est pas une fiction de zombie. Mais la réalité est comme dédoublée. Dans l’hôpital, toutes les spécialités sont dédoublées. Maternité, psychiatrie, pédiatrie, tout en double. On éloigne les covid- 19 des autres. Ce matin, j’ai accueilli une future maman pour la conduire en maternité. On ne peut pas la laisser circuler seule. Mais seule, elle l’était. Le jour où elle a fait son test de grossesse, réfugiée comme une adolescente coupable dans les toilettes, se réjouissant et appréhendant un petit peu de l’annoncer à son homme, je ne pense pas qu’elle avait imaginé qu’elle entrerait seule dans l’hôpital, qu’elle verrait seule sur l’écran de l’échographie, la vision fragile et douce, magique, de son enfant. Je n’ai pas d’enfant. C’est difficile de trouver les mots. Ma perception de la réalité est altérée. Mes sens sont sollicités autrement. J’ai eu besoin d’en parler pour ne pas que ça me bouffe. Comme n’importe qui, j’ai appelé le Service d’Intervention Psycho-social de la Croix-Rouge. J’avais besoin de réconfort, mais je voulais que ça reste anonyme. Je ne vais pas m’étaler là-dessus. J’ai essayé d’expliquer à la personne que j’ai eue en ligne, cette histoire de sens et de réalité. Ce dédoublement. Le reste de la conversation m’appartient, mais dans le fil de la conversation on a parlé un peu « boutique ». Je lui ai demandé comment ça se passait de son côté, au centre d’appel « psy ». Et elle m’a dit cette chose très belle « je n’ai que le son, je travaille avec la voix ». J’ai réalisé que le voile qui recouvre nos vies est sonore. C’est une dimension qui échappe à l’analyse. C’est hyper sensoriel. On entend les oiseaux comme jamais. Une communauté invisible s’est constituée avec les applaudissements de vingt heures. On ne voit pas forcément les gens. On les entend. Cloche, tambour, cri, la ville se réveille au moment où elle s’assoupissait. Tout est plus calme. Mais on entend bien mieux la sirène des ambulances…",Croix Rouge de Belgique,BE,French,fr,SISU,,,,"I did that sound, I work with the voice","This is historic. Three weeks later, the vision of the tent of the Red Cross at the hospital continues to strike me. Twenty-one days later, our medical referral mission became familiar, but I feel like an uncanny. Still, the news is mostly good. Come on, say, encouraging. From our side, the device is in place. Nothing to do with the <em> Rush </em> from the beginning when it was necessary to form teams, lapping procedures, advance to the blind. Volunteers still motivated. It is flat, but the overall atmosphere is good. I suppose, too, without daring to say aloud, in a corner of our fear, we were all more or less imagined a scenario in <em> World War Z </em>, a delirium of off-contamination control, overwhelmed hospitals, race against time with a mutagenic virus fury scene and gladiator combat in the frozen supermarket shelves. In short, the known world in hand torch. Well no. At the beginning of confinement, we hosted up to a hundred people a day. Last week, it dropped to fifty, thirty some days. I hope that the curve flattens. An exceptional sailing seems to arise like a net, light and transparent, on the streets, parks and hospital. On cash flow, but the pressure is there. Our rescue team has integrated the walls. It is right at the entrance. It is inside. This is the first time, to my knowledge. We welcome patients to exit the ambulance to prevent the bearers do not fit into the building. We transfer to the scanner and care units. In short, it circulates throughout the hospital. I was a little apprehensive. Not like a first day in a new job. It is more insidious. Even if the request came from the hospital, I did not want that embarrassment, we walk on the beds. It is a world in itself hospital with formal rules, but also its unwritten code. It takes a good dose of know-being a few degrees of intensity above manners. When I said that the news is encouraging, it was more on the outside. I will not pour into catastrophism, it is not overwhelmed. But inside the hospital the trend has reversed. There are more heavy exams. We are never immune to good news, as my father. I never understood that phrase, though it made me smile. Today, I see what he meant. Three weeks I could not see it. Finally though, but as a cuckoo in the window. I know he has not a terrible vision. I wonder if he sees me half a blur. It hurts me. It's incredible. This virus manages to overturn all our bases. It permeates everyday life, couples, families, rewriting daily. And we, it fits more or less. We accept the distance with our loved ones. But a resigned and suspicious manner. How can I resign myself to be wary of my father? At wary for him, me. I know it's the same for everyone. Distance seems fairer than containment. And I do not know, it's a light and transparent pain, like a veil. So no, the epidemic is not a zombie fiction. But the reality is as split. In the hospital, all specialties are split. Maternity, psychiatry, pediatrics, while double. 19 is dispelled covid- other. This morning I received an expectant mother to take her maternity. We can not let one move. But alone she was. The day she made her pregnancy test, a refugee as a teenager guilty in the toilet, rejoicing and apprehending a little and told her man, I do not think she had imagined it would come only in the hospital, she would see only one on the screen of the ultrasound, fragile and sweet vision, magical, child. I have no children. It's hard to find words. My perception of reality is altered. My senses are otherwise. I needed to talk to do not that it eats me.

Cuéntanos tu historia
</b>
El día 13 de febrero, cuando en España aún sentíamos lejana la epidemia, y no éramos conscientes de que pudiéramos vernos en esta situación. Yo tenía la suerte de volar en dirección a Guinea Bissau con un grupo de cooperantes, dentistas en su mayoría, con los que compartí una experiencia que me hizo sentir que el mundo es frágil, más de lo que somos capaces de apreciar desde la relativa comodidad de nuestros hogares. Siempre he sido consciente de que existen mundos distintos dentro del mismo planeta, pero ahora lo soy mucho más. La primera semana tras mi vuelta el nudo de sentimientos que tenía en mi interior se manifestaban como un deseo incontrolable de dedicarme ayudar a aquellos que más me necesitaran. Aún era finales de febrero, en las noticias ya se empezábamos a ver que en Italia los problemas cada vez eran mayores, la epidemia ya no era algo lejano. Sin embargo, en este momento no tenía la sensación de que donde más me iban a necesitar era en esos hogares españoles en los que todavía nos sentíamos cómodos y seguros. Y quizá esto sea lo más sorprendente de este brote, en cuestión de días, cuando aún no había sido capaz de adaptarme a la rutina del trabajo, todo cambió. De repente nuestro mundo tranquilo y cómodo se veía amenazado.
A medida que la situación se complicaba, mis primeros esfuerzos se centraron en intentar que mi pequeña clínica no se viera afectada, instaurábamos protocolos a diario, pero en menos de una semana se declaró el estado de emergencia, todo iba demasiado rápido, sin margen de reacción. La rutina ya había cambiado... Estábamos frente a una emergencia sanitaria, y yo me preguntaba cómo podía ayudar. Por supuesto seguir tratando todas las urgencias de carácter odontológico era prioritario. Sin embargo, quería hacer algo más y eso me propuse. Pronto contacte con Cruz Roja, y me distéis la oportunidad.
Me siento agradecido de que en estos momentos en los que nuestro día a día ha cambiado y nuestro cómodo estilo de vida se ha visto tan radicalmente afectado, pueda colaborar con una entidad que siempre está al servicio de los que más sufren. El sentimiento de ser partícipe de un plan de acción frente a la crisis más grande que ha vivido mi generación, me llena de orgullo. Siempre he tenido vocación de servicio a los demás, y seguro que lo seguiré teniendo, pero cuando la vida te muestra su cara más dura te alegras de estar en el sitio correcto.",Spanish Red Cross,ES,Spanish,es,Hernán,,,,Suddenly our quiet and comfortable world was threatened,"<B> What has been your experience volunteering in Covid-19?

On 13 February, when Spain still felt far the epidemic, and we were aware that we could see ourselves in this situation. I was lucky enough to fly towards Guinea Bissau with a group of aid workers, dentists mostly with whom I shared an experience that made me feel that the world is fragile, more than we are able to appreciate from the relative comfort of our homes. I've always been aware that there are different worlds within the same planet, but now I'm much more. The first week after my return the knot of feelings I had inside me manifested as an uncontrollable desire to devote help those who needed me. It was still late February, in the news already were beginning to see that in Italy the problems were ever greater, the epidemic was no longer something distant. at this time however, did not feel that where more than I would need was in those Spanish homes that still we felt comfortable and safe. And perhaps this is the most surprising of this outbreak, within days, when he still had not been able to adapt to the routine of work, everything changed. Suddenly our quiet and comfortable world was threatened.
As the situation was complicated, my first efforts focused on trying to get my little clinic is not compromised, instaurábamos protocols daily, but in less than a week the state declared emergency, everything was going too fast, without margin reaction. The routine had changed ... We were faced with a health emergency, and I wondered how he could help. Of course continue to treat all emergency dental character was a priority. However, I wanted to do more and that I proposed. Soon contact Red Cross, and ye gave me the opportunity.
I am grateful that in these times when our daily life has changed and our comfortable lifestyle has been so radically affected, can collaborate with an entity which is always that of those who suffer service. The feeling of being a participant in an action plan against the biggest crisis that my generation has lived, fills me with pride. I've always had a vocation to serve others, and sure I still have, but when life shows you his face harder you glad to be in the right place.","<B> What has been your experience volunteering in Covid-19?

On February 13, when in Spain we still felt the epidemic was distant, and we were not aware that we could see ourselves in this situation. I was fortunate to fly in the direction of Guinea Bissau with a group of cooperators, mostly dentists, with whom I shared an experience that made me feel that the world is fragile, more than we are able to appreciate from the relative comfort of our homes. I have always been aware that there are different worlds within the same planet, but now I am much more. The first week after my return, the knot of feelings that I had inside manifested as an uncontrollable desire to dedicate myself to helping those who needed me the most. It was still the end of February, in the news we were already beginning to see that in Italy the problems were getting bigger, the epidemic was no longer something distant. However, at this moment I did not have the feeling that where they were going to need me the most was in those Spanish homes where we still felt comfortable and safe. And perhaps this is the most surprising thing about this outbreak, in a matter of days, when I still had not been able to adapt to the work routine, everything changed. Suddenly our calm and comfortable world was threatened.
As the situation became more complicated, my first efforts focused on trying not to affect my small clinic, we established protocols daily, but in less than a week the state of emergency was declared, everything was going too fast, with no margin for reaction. The routine had already changed ... We were facing a health emergency, and I was wondering how I could help. Of course, continuing to treat all dental emergencies was a priority. However, I wanted to do something more and that was my intention. Right away I contacted the Red Cross, and they give me the opportunity.
I am grateful that in these moments in which our daily lives have changed and our comfortable lifestyle has been so radically affected, I can collaborate with an entity that is always at the service of those who suffer the most. The feeling of being part of an action plan against the biggest crisis that my generation has lived through, fills me with pride. I have always had a vocation to serve others, and I will surely continue to have it, but when life shows you its hardest face you are happy to be in the right place.",,Yes,,,Health/medical screening/ambulances

Como en mi pueblo hay una oficina de Cruz Roja decidí apuntarme. Aunque siempre me había llamado la atención no me decidí hasta que empezó el estado de alarma. Ver a la gente trabajar con un mismo fin y poder dar servicio a la sociedad ha sido muy provechoso para mí, ha hecho que me sienta satisfecha emocionalmente conmigo misma y con mi papel en la sociedad.
Esta situación ha hecho que cambie la manera de relacionarme con la gente en general, el echar de menos a tu gente, no poder verlos más que a través de la pantalla es muy duro y más sabiendo que emocionalmente para ellos está siendo muy complicado. El tiempo pasa diferente, te das cuenta de lo realmente valioso, aprecias mucho más a la familia, amigos y compañeros, los abrazos, los besos, los momentos...
Con el tiempo vas pensando y aprendes a valorar la libertad. a echar de menos de verdad, te pones en la piel de la gente que está sola, la gente que tiene que esconderse por proteger su vida en guerras y situaciones límite de sus vidas y te planteas muchas cosas.
Por primera vez hemos podido ver cómo es realmente la sociedad, cómo son las personas, tanto para bien como para mal. Ves el individualismo, muchos sacan el egoísmo a la luz. Pero lo que más sorprende es cantidad de gente que está dando su tiempo, dinero, materiales... para ayudar a la sociedad. Los movimientos masivos para apoyar a los profesionales, trabajadores, voluntarios y gente de a pié que pone en riesgo su vida para todos.
Lo mejor de este brote llegará cuando todo pase, ha sido un punto de inflexión social donde seguro que nos plantearemos muchas cosas. La gente cuando pueda salir sacará lo mejor de si mismo y al menos durante un tiempo tendremos una sociedad volcada y plenamente humana. Sonreiremos mucho más, nos relacionaremos, dejaremos de lado las pantallas y nos abriremos al mundo.
Creo que entre todos haremos de esto algo grande y hará que el mundo sea un lugar más humano.

Seeing people working with the same goal and to serve society has been very helpful for me, has made me feel emotionally satisfied with myself and my role in society.
This situation has to change the way of interacting with people in general, miss your people, not to see them rather than through the screen is very hard and knowing that emotionally for them is still very complicated. Time passes differently, you realize what is really valuable, much appreciate the family, friends and colleagues, hugs, kisses, moments ...
Eventually're thinking and learn to appreciate freedom. miss really, you put on the skin of people who are lonely, people who have to hide to protect their lives in wars and extreme situations in their lives and you are thinking many things.
For the first time we have seen how society really is, how are the people, both good and bad. You see individualism, many selfishness take to light. But what is more surprising amount of people who are giving their time, money, materials ... to help society. Mass movements to support professionals, workers, volunteers and ordinary people threatening his life for everyone.
The best thing about this outbreak will come when everything happens, it has been a social turning point where we are sure we will consider many things. When people can bring out the best out of himself and the least for a while we will have a slam dunk and fully human society. Will smile more, we will relate, we leave aside the screens and will open us to the world.
I think that we all do something big and this will make the world a more humane place.

Eventually're thinking and learn to appreciate freedom. miss really, you put on the skin of people who are lonely, people who have to hide to protect their lives in wars and extreme situations in their lives and you are thinking many things.
For the first time we have seen how society really is, how are the people, both good and bad. You see individualism, many selfishness take to light. But what is more surprising amount of people who are giving their time, money, materials ... to help society. Mass movements to support professionals, workers, volunteers and ordinary people threatening his life for everyone.
The best thing about this outbreak will come when everything happens, it has been a social turning point where we are sure we will consider many things. When people can bring out the best out of himself and the least for a while we will have a slam dunk and fully human society. Will smile more, we will relate, we leave aside the screens and will open us to the world.
I think that we all do something big and this will make the world a more humane place.

Seeing people work for the same purpose and being able to serve society has been very helpful to me, it has made me feel emotionally satisfied with myself and my role in society.

El brote de coronavirus ha cambiado mi día a día por completo. Antes no tenía tiempo para nada debido a las duras jornadas de trabajo y el poco tiempo que me quedaba era para estar con mi familia.

Hola soy Sofia Mallorgas
Formo parte del grupo de Voluntariado Social de la asamblea de Creu Roja Muntanya de Montserrat, Judith y Mar son nuestros ojos y nuestras manos a la hora de prepararnos para salir a cualquier labor social y ahora en este momento que vivimos del COVID-19 nos han formado en prevención y EPI para que podamos colaborar con los que más lo necesiten. Desde el primer llamamiento que hicieron al grupo de voluntari@s me ofrecí para poder ayudar, organizaron planning semanal con usuarios ya asiduos a la asamblea y otros nuevos, es un trabajo muy fluido gracias a su gestión. Salimos a entregar la compra, a llevar medicación, sacar basuras y entregarles lo mejor de nosotros con una mirada, una sonrisa, o el sonido de nuestra voz. Me resulta muy gratificante y me llena plenamente poder dedicar mi tiempo a mejorar la vida de otras personas, es el mejor “hobbie” que puedo tener. Y me emociono al escribirlo.
<b>¿Cómo ha cambiado el brote de coronavirus tu vida diaria?</b>
Mi vida laboral cesó desde el primer día de confinamiento sin saber cuándo iba a volver, mi hija dejó de ir al instituto y de hacer sus actividades y se sumó la labor de cuidar de mis mayores ya que mi madre dejó de acudir al centro de día.
Es muy raro romper la monotonía de un día para otro es muy costoso mental y emocionalmente, como si te ataran de pies y manos.
<b>¿Qué has aprendido del brote de coronavirus?</b>
Lo débiles que podemos ser ante un “bichito” y lo mucho que puede unir a las personas que quieren luchar y ayudar. He visto los 2 extremos del ser humano: el dedicado y solidario y el que da la espalda. Por suerte el lado solidario es el que siempre triunfa.
<b>En el contexto de Coronavirus, ¿qué has hecho que te enorgullece?</b>
Colaborar en hacer más llevadero el confinamiento a personas mayores o positivos en cuarentena y no solo por la labor de proporcionarles la compra semanal o medicación sino porque agradecían escuchar nuestras voces a través de una puerta o ver nuestras caras, aunque fuese a unos metros de distancia, sus miradas y sus “gracias” eran abrazos.
<b>Como persona voluntaria, ¿cuál es el principal desafío durante este brote de Covid-19? </b>
El protocolo de prevención, el antes, el durante y el después de cada domicilio
<b>¿Qué has visto por primera vez debido a Covid-19?</b>
Lo traumático que puede ser guardar cuarentena y verse sin ayuda y sin saber cómo actuar
<b>¿Cómo crees que el ánimo y la esperanza pueden aumentar a través de nuestra respuesta al coronavirus?</b>
Creo que saber que pueden contar con nosotros para cualquier necesidad les da una tranquilidad que el aislamiento les roba",Spanish Red Cross,ES,Spanish,es,Sofia,,,,I've seen the two extremes of the human being: the dedicated and caring and giving back,"<B> What has been your experience volunteering in Covid-19? </B>

Poder colaborar y actuar como voluntario durante esta fatídica pandemia ha significado, por muchos motivos, una experiencia muy motivadora a la par que profunda.

Las he visto de todos los colores y formas, pero cómo el Coronavirus, ninguna.
A pesar de las recomendaciones que todo el mundo entiende, nuestro espíritu de voluntariado nos impide quedarnos en casa cuando fuera hay personas que lo están pasando peor que uno mismo. Pero como en Cruz Roja nos motiva hacer aquellas actividades que no están cubiertas por la sociedad y, por suerte, los servicios con ambulancia están dejando de ser una necesidad no cubierta, todos los voluntarios que venimos del área de socorros y emergencias nos estamos reinventado al ámbito social. Más ahora que hay una emergencia y hay gente que necesita socorro.
Sin embargo, hay personas que viven en nuestras ciudades, en nuestros pueblos, que no pueden quedarse en casa. Mas que nada porque no tienen casa, no tienen hogar dónde confinarse durante el estado de alarma, no tienen sitio para poder protegerse del COVID-19.
De modo que gracias y con coordinación con las administraciones locales, hemos habilitado un espacio público con duchas, cocina, habitaciones amplias, calefacción, espacios abiertos al aire libre y cerrados por si el tiempo no acompaña, para que todas las personas que no pueden quedarse en casa, ahora sí puedan hacerlo. Y en solo 3 días, el equipo de técnicos y voluntarios de nuestra sede local, ha habilitado con muchísimo esfuerzo éste espacio para acoger a todas aquellas personas sin hogar que quieran, como tu o como yo, tener un sitio dónde estar para no contagiarse y, sobre todo, no contagiar a los demás por la calle. En solo 3 días hemos habilitado 30 camas, 4 comidas al día dos de las cuales son calientes, y ya, 17 hombres y mujeres se refugian del maldito Coronavirus en nuestro albergue, su albergue. Van llegando poco a poco. Pero no todas las personas que vienen se quedan: como a ti como a mí, no les gusta estar confinados y, a pesar de “vender” el espacio lo mejor que podemos para que se queden, a pesar de intentar concienciarlas de la importancia del confinamiento para su seguridad y la de los demás, alguna no se quiere quedar. Te cuentan sus atropelladas vidas para justificar su decisión e incluso alguna, a pesar de que nos reproche que “cuando terminemos nuestro turno aquí, nos iremos a nuestras casas con cama y comida caliente”, nosotros seguiremos estando a su lado para que, si algún día cambia de opinión, tenga unas manos, un corazón y una Cruz que la acoja.

Por miedo, imagino",http://future-rcrc.com/testimonial/escogi-no-abrir-los-ojos-por-miedo-imagino/,"Tue, 07 Apr 2020 18:59:17 +0000",http://future-rcrc.com/?post_type=wpm-testimonial&p=218165,"Hasta el jueves 11 de marzo yo apenas prestaba atención a las noticias que llegaban de China y de Italia sobre un virus muy contagioso. Algunos lo comparaban con una gripe un poco más fuerte de lo normal, y yo escogí quedarme con esa analogía. Aunque no fuera plenamente consciente de estar escogiendo, la realidad es que lo estaba haciendo. Escogí no abrir los ojos. Por miedo, imagino. Pero ese jueves todo cambió porque nos informaron, como a todo el país, de que a partir del lunes día 15 se cerraba casi todo. Entre otras cosas, el polideportivo municipal. Por tiempo indefinido. Y ahí empezó mi crisis particular: el cierre del polideportivo significaba que no podría ir a nadar. Practico este deporte desde hace solo unos meses, pero desde entonces, y hasta el 11 de marzo, nadaba entre cinco y seis días a la semana. Soy nadadora. Es así. Mi cuerpo ha respondido a este deporte como nunca lo ha hecho con ningún otro, y nadar a diario es casi una necesidad para mí. Casi.
Hoy es día 6 de abril. Hace dos o tres semanas, ese “casi” no habría formado parte de la frase, pero hoy se me antoja imposible decir categóricamente que algo así es necesario. Es sano, es importante, es divertido. Pero no imprescindible. Muchas cosas han cambiado en menos de un mes. Entre ellas, el hecho de que ahora soy voluntaria de la Cruz Roja y dedico unas horas a la semana a hacer llamadas a personas a las que, por una razón u otra, se considera que son más vulnerables. La gran mayoría de las personas a las que llamo, tienen setenta o más años, y muchas viven solas, a veces en pueblos aislados donde ni siquiera hay vecinos con los que charlar un rato de ventana a ventana; o con los que aplaudir, desde el balcón, el trabajo de las personas que tanto se esfuerzan para que podamos salir de esta crisis lo antes posible. De ahí que entre los objetivos de las llamadas, además de los obvios (comprobar si están bien de salud y/o si tienen alguna necesidad que Cruz Roja pueda subsanar, informar acerca de las medidas de higiene y prevención contra el COVID-19, etc.) figure el de ofrecer compañía a la persona que está al otro lado de la línea.
Muchas llamadas se acaban en cuestión de dos o tres minutos. En algunos casos, porque enseguida queda claro  que la persona en cuestión tiene prisa por colgar (a lo mejor la has pillado cocinando o a lo mejor simplemente no le apetece hablar, contigo o con nadie, o no lo necesita); pero otras veces las palabras se suceden y las conversaciones se extienden. Te hablan de su vida, de sus hijos e hijas, de sus miedos, de la soledad que sienten a veces a pesar de estar bien atendidos porque su familia y amistades les llevan comida, los llaman continuamente y les transmiten lo mucho que los quieren de todas las formas posibles. Pero hay demasiado tiempo para pensar cuando uno tiene que estar encerrado tantas horas, tantos días; y es muy fácil que la tristeza se deslice en nuestra vida diaria, casi sin que nos demos cuenta. Ahora lo sabemos.
Por todo ello, quiero pensar que estas llamadas que hacemos, yo y tantos otros, significan algo; aportan un toque de ánimo, de esperanza, a las personas que están al otro lado del teléfono. Aunque solo nos conozcan por nuestras voces y nuestros nombres.  Aunque nosotros mismos estemos re-ubicándonos, redefiniendo nuestros “casi” y nuestras prioridades; acostumbrándonos a una nueva realidad; y descubriendo que somos tanto o más vulnerables que las personas a las que tratamos de ayudar.",Spanish Red Cross,QA,Spanish,es,Carla,,,,"I chose not to open my eyes. Fear, I imagine","Until Thursday, March 11 I barely paid attention to the news from China and Italy on a highly contagious virus. Some compared it to a slightly stronger than normal flu, and I chose to stay with that analogy. Even if not fully conscious of choosing, the reality is that I was doing. I chose not to open my eyes. Out of fear, I imagine. But everything changed that Thursday because we were informed, as the whole country, that from Monday 15th it closed almost everything. Among other things, the municipal sports center. Indefinitely. And there began my particular crisis: the closure of the sports meant I could not go swimming. I practice this sport since a few months ago, but since then until March 11, swam five to six days a week. I am a swimmer. It is. My body has responded to this sport as it has never done with any other, and swim daily is almost a necessity for me. Almost.
Today is April 6. two or three weeks ago, that ""almost"" would not have been part of the sentence, but today it seems to me impossible to say categorically that something needed. Is healthy, it is important, it's fun. But not essential. Many things have changed in less than a month. Among them the fact that I am now a volunteer for the Red Cross and spend a few hours a week to make calls to people who, for one reason or another, are considered to be most vulnerable. The vast majority of the people I call have seventy or more years, and many live alone, sometimes in isolated villages where there are not even neighbors with whom a chat window to window; or with applaud from the balcony, the work of people who work so hard to get us out of this crisis as soon as possible. Hence, among the objectives also calls the obvious (check if they are in good health and /or if they have any need for Red Cross to fill, report on hygiene measures and prevention against COVID-19, etc. .) showing the company offering the person on the other side of the line.
Many calls are finished within two or three minutes. In some cases, because then it is clear that the person in question in a hurry to hang up (maybe you caught the cook or maybe you just do not want to talk with you or with anyone, or does not need); but sometimes the words succeed and extend conversations. You talk about their lives, their children, their fears, loneliness that sometimes feel despite being well taken care of because your family and friends bring them food, they call them continuously and they convey how much you want to every possible way. But there is too much time to think when you have to be locked up so many hours, many days; and it is very easy to slide sadness in our daily lives, almost without our noticing. Now we know.
Therefore, I think that these calls do I and so many others, mean something; bring a touch of encouragement, hope, people who are on the other side of the phone. Although we only know through our voices and our names. Although we ourselves are re-locating us, redefining our ""almost"" and our priorities; getting used to a new reality; and discovering that we are equally or more vulnerable than people who try to help.","Until Thursday, March 11 I barely paid attention to the news from China and Italy on a highly contagious virus.

Mi experiencia ante esta pandemia ha sido innovadora y un momento de conexión con mis creencias y conmigo misma, debo admitir que no es sencillo no preocuparse sin embargo he tomado hábitos saludables gracias al COVID-19 y me he dado cuenta de la fragilidad del ser humano ante la naturaleza, convivo mucho con mi familia es difícil a veces nos gritamos mucho, pero creo que aprendo más de cada uno a diario, la vulnerabilidad de nuestras almas se muestra en esta situación.
<b>¿Cómo ha cambiado el brote de coronavirus tu vida diaria?</b>
Como dije anteriormente he tomado hábitos más saludables, me ejército y tengo más disciplina, valoro más los alimentos y el tiempo de los demás además me motiva a hacer cosas productivas.
<b>¿Qué has aprendido del brote de coronavirus?</b>
He aprendido que la vida puede ser una hoy pero el mañana es incierto, que todos los días debemos amar sin medida y perdonar en la misma línea, que no debemos esperar para hacer las cosas y que debemos cuidar el planeta como el tesoro que es.
<b>En el contexto de Coronavirus, ¿qué has hecho que te enorgullece?</b>
Estoy en mi tercera semana ejercitándome y consumiendo alimentos más saludables, para mi es difícil pues no soy disciplinada, pero lo he logrado a pesar de que es un proceso difícil.
<b>Como voluntario, ¿cuál es el principal desafío durante este brote de Covid-19?</b>
Existen muchos por ejemplo yo quisiera estar apoyando sin embargo en nuestro país es poca la protección personal que se nos provee, vale más el dinero que la vida humana, no puedo salir porque mi mamá no podría cerrar un solo ojo pensando en mí. Además, el hecho de pensar que es un proceso difícil incluso para uno mismo lo hace más mortificante.
<b>¿Qué has visto por primera vez debido a Coronavirus?</b>
A mí misma cumpliendo objetivos, la fragilidad de las personas ante la pandemia, la vulnerabilidad de autoestima de la mayoría, la apatía de muchos y el gran corazón que tienen algunos.
<b>¿Puedes decirnos cómo puede surgir la esperanza de la respuesta de Coronavirus?</b>

Como ya hace dos años decidí trabajar en mi comunidad ayudando en el tema de seguridad en conjunto con la Policía Nacional tengo todos los contactos y la base de datos que me enfoque en tener cuantos adultos mayores, niños y personas con enfermedades catastróficas hay en mi sector porque siempre se presentan casos y vienen a pedirme ayuda al saber que soy de Cruz Roja.

Entonces he hecho el enlace en si para comprar ya que algunos son adultos mayores no saben usar WhatsApp y no pueden pedir solos así que los voy guiando y dando ciertas pautas como a veces recetas diarias saludables para que sepan distribuir la comida y no gastarla innecesariamente ya que necesitamos nutrirnos bien. Con este proceso he logrado tener ya personas fijas que traen los alimentos de casa en casa.
Es un sistema muy bonito cuando se hace la entrega de las cosas ya que de casa en casa van saliendo y con todo el sistema de limpieza que les he dicho que deben hacer van diciendo ok ya cogi y sigue la siguiente y asi. Se ha logrado no tener cobro de envió ya que son algunas familias.
Aparte de eso al tener los números telefónicos se puede conversar sobre todo con aquellos que se sienten deprimidos y además se les hace una llamada para saber como se siente así sepan que alguien está pendiente de ellos.
De todo esto creo que he aprendido que no es necesario ir hasta la junta para poder ayudar y que así haciendo pequeñas cosas también se ayuda. Debido a que no solo envió los contactos de los distribuidores a mis vecinos sino a otros amigos de otros sectores y así ellos pueden pedir desde casa y no salir.
Aparte he aprendido de toda esta pandemia que hay que ser solidarios aún en estos momentos tan duros. Ahora mi vida diaria es hacer de call center 😉.
Como persona voluntaria a sido el mayor desafío entender que por salud debo quedarme en casa aunque tenga todas la ganas de vestir mi uniforme y salir a ayudar no es posible debo cuidarme primero yo para poder ayudar a otros.
Y da esperanza? creo que si este tipo de actividad porque es bueno saber que otra persona que no sea tu familia se preocupa por ti y sobre todo sin nada a cambio está ayudándote y ayudando a tu familia.",Ecuadorian Red Cross,EC,Spanish,es,Gloria,,,,Help my community without leaving home,"A volunteer be the Red Cross is very important to help the community around me not wait to go far away to help.

Then I set to work figuring out I started checking first people on all networks or distributors to bring home food and medicine, so you can order by phone everything for families and to achieve do not leave and stay at home.

With this process I have achieved and still have people who bring food from home to home.
It is a very nice system when delivering things as house to house is going out and cleaning the entire system I've told them they should do are saying ok and cogi and follows the next and so on. There has been no collection be sent as they are some families.
Apart from that to having the phone numbers you can discuss everything with those who feel depressed and also it makes them a call to find out how it feels like to know that someone is aware of them.
From all this I think I've learned that it is not necessary to go to the board to help and thus doing little things also help. Because not only sent the contact dealers to my neighbors but other friends from other sectors and so they can order from home and not go out.
Besides I learned from all this pandemic must be even solidarity in these hard times. My daily life now is to call center 😉.

By having to be quarantined in my Country Ecuador in my city Guayaquil which is the focus of greatest contagion. I started to think about how I could help without having to leave the house, because for health because I am asthmatic I cannot leave.
As two years ago I decided to work in my community helping with security issues in conjunction with the National Police, I have all the contacts and the database that focuses on having as many older adults, children and people with catastrophic diseases as there are in my sector. Because there are always cases and they come to ask me for help knowing that I am from the Red Cross.
So I got down to work, I started first by checking all the networks for people or distributors that bring medicine and food to the home, so that I can order everything necessary for families by phone and thus prevent them from going out and staying at home. So I have made the link itself to buy since some are older adults do not know how to use WhatsApp and can not order alone so I am guiding them and giving certain guidelines such as sometimes healthy daily recipes so that they know how to distribute the food and not spend it unnecessarily anymore that we need to nourish ourselves well. With this process I have already managed to have permanent people who bring food from house to house.
It is a very nice system when things are delivered as they go out from house to house and with all the cleaning system that I have told them to do they say ok and I picked up and continue the next one and so on. It has been possible to not have shipping charges since they are some families.
Apart from that, having the phone numbers you can talk especially with those who feel depressed and also make a call to find out how they feel so they know that someone is watching them.
From all this I think I have learned that it is not necessary to go to the meeting to be able to help and that doing small things also helps. Because I not only sent the contacts of the distributors to my neighbors but to other friends from other sectors and so they can order from home and not go out.
Besides I have learned from all this pandemic that you have to be supportive even in these difficult times. Now my daily life is to do a call center 😉.
As a volunteer, it has been the biggest challenge to understand that for health I must stay at home even if I have all the desire to wear my uniform and go out to help it is not possible. I must take care of myself first to be able to help others.

The Coronavirus outbreak has shown me that communication is a very important key in our daily lives. Talking to each other and exchanging thoughts about how to stay safe in this situation are topics discussed on an everyday basis. People putting their minds together and working together for a common cause, despite other differences. This gives me a great feeling.
From my point of view, the biggest challenge of a volunteers is to stay healthy, especially while working as a frontline.

Le virus en question y faisant des ravages et ses victimes se comptaient par milliers. A aucun moment, je n’ai imaginé que le Covid-19 aurait pu sortir de cette zone géographique et atteindre toutes les parties du globe sans exception et devenir ainsi une pandémie universelle. Cet organisme microscopique poursuit malheureusement à ce jour son chemin à travers le temps et l’espace.
Le premier cas de maladie au Togo a été annoncé le 06 mars 2020. A ce jour, il est dénombré officiellement 65 cas confirmés dont 39 actifs, 23 personnes guéris et 03 décès.
Avant que le gouvernement togolais ne décrète <b><em>l’état d’urgence </em></b>le jeudi 02 avril 2020, nous avons heureusement pu briefer les volontaires en groupes très restreints sur la pandémie et les gestes barrières pour endiguer sa propagation.
Ces volontaires formés sur la problématique du covid 19 se relaient sur les 25 stations radio avec lesquelles la Croix-Rouge Togolaise a dû signer des contrats pour sensibiliser le grand public avec l’approche CEA (Community Engagement and Accountability) : collecte des rumeurs, analyse, restitution, communication des bonnes méthodes préventives, conduite à tenir en présence d’un cas suspect…
Vu la contagiosité élevée de la maladie et dans le respect des dispositions prises par les autorités sanitaires au nombre desquelles, la distanciation sociale, les volontaires ne peuvent pas être déployés sur le terrain au risque d’être exposés au virus ou de devenir source de contamination puisque le défi est de rompre éventuellement la chaîne de contamination.
En effet, de par son mode de contamination, nous sommes en présence d’un virus qui se propage à une allure vertigineuse jamais vécue par l’humanité. Le monde n’a jamais connu une maladie qui ait fait autant de victimes ; des décès qui se compte par milliers en un jour. Pour l’heure, aucun remède ne fait l’unanimité. Puisse cela servir à réaliser la limite de l’intelligence humaine face à la force de la nature.
Pour le moment, l’homme ne devra son salut qu’au respect scrupuleux des gestes barrières et à la providence.
Il a suffi de quelques jours pour que le songe devienne mensonge ! Il a suffi de quelques jours pour que l’humanité prenne conscience qu’elle n’est que souffle et poussière. Qui sommes-nous ? Que valons-nous ? Que pouvons-nous face à ce virus ?
Il a suffi de quelques jours pour que la certitude devienne incertitude, que la force devienne faiblesse, que le pouvoir devienne solidarité et concertation. Il nous faut subtilement faire une introspection pour comprendre la valeur des mots <b><em>solidarité et vulnérabilité</em></b>.
Oui, la solidarité et la concertation remarquables dans la recherche d’un remède efficace pour éradiquer cette pandémie constituent le pouvoir de l’humanité auquel le monde fait appel si rarement. Si tout le monde se sent concerné par les défis auxquels fait face notre terre, des solutions efficaces et pérennes leur seraient déjà trouvées.
Ce fléau que nous vivons actuellement commence déjà par engendrer une crise économique due à la suspension de beaucoup d’activités créatrices de richesses qui entrainera le chômage, l’insécurité alimentaire…

I am happy to share my own experience regarding the COVID-19 outbreak, which is quite simple. First of all, I think beyond everything this outbreak brought over unity in the entire world. Each nation, individual, organization and institution, all of them are selflessly striving for the eradication of COVID-19 with one vision and religion of HUMANITY. This outbreak made us recognize our roles as youth leaders, while everyone was panicking, only us; volunteers were responding and helping the victimized community. I observed in Pakistan that every organization was collecting donations for daily wagers who are suffering from lockdown but only a few of them were working for transgenders, people with disabilities and minorities and they were ignored in these testing times.
Initially, I started public awareness in the general community about COVID-19. I was also a part of Pakistan Red Crescent’s screening team of suspected cases at Railway station Peshawar. When the government decided to go for lockdown, together with my volunteer friends we started fundraising for the most affected people from lockdown. First, I focused on the transgender community because they have been isolated from the beginning and start delivering them a ration of one month. I have delivered about 70 monthly ration packages to 70 groups of transgenders in three districts. And still working to collect more funds for minorities and persons with disabilities.
I observed that the trans community was following the precautionary protocols seriously, I asked one of them that why you people are so cautious she replied we were not treated as humans in normal times so how would we be treated in this pandemic situation if we got infected. We know that no one will own us so we are helping ourselves. After that, I received positive feedback from transgender's focal person that thanks for highlighting our issues and taking the initiative now we are receiving donations from different organizations. This moment made me proud that I did something better for a community that has been marginalized.
Some of the following challenges I faced in this pandemic situation:
1. The COVID-19 is quite new for us in Pakistan and the entire world so it was difficult to understand and to aware community about its spread and precautions.
2. It was very tough to collect funds for helping the transgender community because they are marginalized and considered as a social pariah.
3. Lack of personal protective equipment’s to go to quarantine areas.
Due to COVID-19, I experienced the following things first time in my life:
1. Mosques are locked for prayers.
2. People avoid shaking hands and hugs.
3. People are in terror and panic.
4. I saw lockdown for the first time.
I believe there is always a ray of hope. The pandemic brought us on one page to fight against it. The whole nation is strictly following precautionary measures.

Fugir significa fazer isso mesmo quando confrontado com um cenário de Emergência. Fugir de uma situação de perigo é um instinto de sobrevivência e a resposta automática do corpo humano num cenário de perigo.
Congelar significa ficar estático numa situação de perigo; o pânico é tanto que a pessoa fica literalmente presa ao chão como se tivesse congelado.
A minha resposta favorita é Enfrentar! Enfrentar/ Lutar não significa que não existe medo, pelo contrário - utiliza-se o medo para algo positivo. A resposta de lutar só pode acontecer se o indivíduo estiver informado e souber o que está a fazer. Imagina que há um pequeno incêndio no teu fogão:
• tu foges e sais da cozinha (bom, o resultado final poderá ser a tua casa inteira destruída pelas chamas porque tu fugiste);
• tu congelas e ficas ali parado (o resultado pode ser bem mais grave, podes ficar queimado e destruir toda a tua casa);
• tu lutas e colocas um cobertor por cima do fogo ou água (acabaste de te salvar a ti mesmo, a tua casa e as pessoas à tua volta).

Tenho coordenado voluntários, participado na compra e entrega de alimentos e medicamentos a pessoas do grupo de risco em isolamento profilático, tenho entregue alimentos a famílias e indivíduos carênciados e apoiado a Proteção Civil em alguns pedidos.
A maior lição que tenho aprendido com a pandemia é que as competências técnicas são ensináveis, mas os comportamentos não.

• You congelas and Ficas parado wings (or pode resultado ser mais bem serious, podes ficar queimado and destruir toda at home);
• You Lutas and colocas por um cobertor top do fogo ou agua (de acabaste you save a ti mesmo, to your house and your time as a pessoas).

Com or desenvolvimento from situação and increase or do número de casos, a carga de trabalho tem Aumentado and continues to aumentar diariamente. Tenho coordenado Voluntários, participado na buy and entrega de alimentos and medicamentos to pessoas su grupo de risco em profilático isolation, tenho entregue alimentos to famílias and individuos carênciados and apoiado to Proteção Civil em alguns pedidos.
A maior lição que tenho aprendido com a pandemic is as Competencias técnicas que são ensináveis, mas não os comportamentos.
O que é que quer dizer isto? Que ser a pessoa you podes corn Qualificada do mundo, mas if colocares as tuas Competencias não ao serviço dos outros when eles precisam corn, Então elas não valem nada.

Running away means doing this even when faced with an Emergency scenario. Running away from a dangerous situation is a survival instinct and the automatic response of the human body in a dangerous scenario.
Freezing means being static in a dangerous situation; the panic is so great that the person is literally stuck to the ground as if he had frozen.
My favorite answer is Face it! Facing / Fighting does not mean that there is no fear, on the contrary - fear is used for something positive. The fight response can only happen if the individual is informed and knows what he is doing. Imagine that there is a small fire in your stove:
• you run away and leave the kitchen (well, the end result could be your entire house destroyed by the flames because you ran away);
• you freeze and stay there (the result can be much more serious, you can get burned and destroy your whole house);
• you fight and put a blanket over fire or water (you just saved yourself, your house and the people around you).
When the Covid-19 outbreak in Portugal started, I saw young people """" disappear """". The Red Cross volunteers, my own friends. The volunteers did not bother to ask how they could be useful, if there was anything they could do  ...
As the situation develops and the number of cases increases, the workload has increased and continues to increase daily. I have coordinated volunteers, participated in the purchase and delivery of food and medicines to people in the risk group in prophylactic isolation, I have delivered food to needy families and individuals and supported the Civil Protection in some requests.
The biggest lesson I have learned from the pandemic is that technical skills are teachable, but behaviors are not.
What does this mean? That you can be the most qualified person in the world, but if you don't put your skills at the service of others when they need it most, then they are worthless.
I have learned that life and what each one does with it, especially in moments like the one we live in, has more to do with our actions than with our words.","Facing it does not mean there is not fear, on the contrary, fear is used for something positive",Yes,,NOTE the story is in Portuguese not Italian. so the title is wrong,"Food assistance and delivery,Working with vulnerable populations/homeless/disabled/elderly"

This is Sarah Rashid from Pakistan Red Crescent Society, Pakistan.  I did not intend to write the story as I can not be considered an active participant in the corona outbreak response but after reading a few stories, I am writing it because there is always another side of the picture and my story may give voice to it.
So, I initially joined the team of responders who were supposed to screen people at different entrance points in the city. I participated for a day or two this way but then as advised by many I thought about the other aspects of response. I considered the guidelines of IFRC of staying home for saving lives. Like many others in the world, we were short of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs). Without proper PPEs, interacting with many people and then coming back to our homes and communities was more about risking the lives of many others in the community rather than a fruitful response to the outbreak. So I kept using the plate form of social media for awareness, sharing authenticated information and doing all my efforts to support the teams who were doing fundraising for the financially vulnerable groups including the excluded populations such as transgenders in our community.
Under the lead of Muazzam shah and Haseeb Zafer Iqbal, we are now planning to raise funds for the disabled, so that they may not have a crisis of food and other necessities during the lockdown.
I have observed that response to this outbreak is not the same as the response to the other disasters we have faced previously. It needs a lot of care and many technicalities should be considered before initiating a response because a minor case of our carelessness can convert this relief response to a hazard for the respective community. Therefore, merely trusting our sentiments as a volunteer of the RCRC movement would not be enough but considering a search for safer ways of response is also necessary. In this regard, I would appreciate the approach of the ‘ahtiyat karona campaign’ where they give awareness to people through a tollfree number. So, I have learned that the response to the emergency would not always mean rushing to the field and looking for safer ways of response would be more important than the rapid deployment of responders.
What makes me proud is that when the cases in our region start rising, though I have left the screening campaign then, as a concerned fellow of our volunteers, I contacted people in the management and volunteers and asked them to consider the safety of volunteers and their communities and stop the campaign unless we had the right PPEs. Because it was not only about risking the life of volunteers but also, they could be the source of the spread of the virus in their respective communities. I don’t know how much I contributed to the cause of that campaign, but I did what was due on my part and as an RCRC volunteer, I am proud of that. Fundraising for the vulnerable groups also makes me feel satisfied with my role in response to the pandemic but is secondary to it.
The challenge that I consider for the volunteers of response was initially the shortage of PPEs. But another challenge that I felt and considered it important to be addressed is the role of volunteer leaders. Few campaigns were launched by the PRCS management but the safety of volunteers as I have observed was not considered. There are many other ways through which many of the objectives of the campaigns could be achieved but the role of volunteer leaders in any such decisions is not considered who could talk about the safety of volunteers and the pros and cons of sending volunteers to the risky fields.
For the first time, I have observed that we can save many lives by staying home. I have seen the lockdown for the first time in my life and observed how it affects different communities and as an RCRC volunteer what we can do for these communities. I have seen that despite the lockdown and many other hurdles we accessed many people and helped them in their crisis so with a positive attitude we can always accomplish many tasks and achieve our goals no matter what hurdles we face. This pandemic also allowed us to observe that we are all equally vulnerable whenever there is any calamity. The virus discriminated no one, the rich and the poor, the black and the white we all are equally vulnerable and all of us are on the same page to fight against it.
Though the situation is panic at the moment,  here we can be the lanterns of hope. As an RCRC volunteer, we need to take an active role and give hope to the people by spreading positive news. We need to take a serious approach while sharing news regarding the pandemic as not everyone is equally psychologically resilient to bear the news therefore, we need to owe some responsibility while sharing any information. By spreading some positive news, knowledge that help people how to save themselves and people around them and that give them some sense of control against this virus, we can contribute a lot in giving hope to the world.",Pakistan Red Crescent,PK,English,en,Sarah,,,,Carelessness can convert this relief response to a hazard for the respective community,"Hello Everyone

218302,Life before and after COVID-19,http://future-rcrc.com/testimonial/life-before-and-after-covid-19/,"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 15:20:22 +0000",http://future-rcrc.com/?post_type=wpm-testimonial&p=218302,"Unfortunately, the year 2020 started with the saddest news. Literally every day since the beginning of the year we get more and more horrific news about the virus, news about ongoing infections, and unfortunately, about deaths from COVID19. All friendly feasts, business meetings, conversations on romantic dates necessarily began with a discussion of the latest data on the situation with the coronavirus, becoming a parable in languages. This global problem has shocked everyone, including me.
My name is Chingiz-khan, I'm 28 years old, and I work at a bank. Every day I was like the last one. So to speak, I've been living Groundhog Day for the last five years. Many times I promised myself to change - I thought that I would work for one more year, and time flew by unnoticed and for the 5th year I am a bank employee. At the end of March, a state of emergency was declared in Kyrgyzstan and all of us were sent home, it is necessary to isolate ourselves and try not to contact a large number of people. Honestly, at the beginning I have lost - what to do with a lot of free time. Well, we're living in a digital age and we're getting plenty of information. One day ""hanging out"" on the Internet, I came across an ad of the Red Crescent of Kyrgyzstan, which said about recruiting volunteers to help during COVID19. I had never done anything like this before and had little understanding of why volunteering was necessary. But I decided to try myself in volunteering, because now, at such a difficult time, not only for our country, but also for the world, any support is necessary and important. After filling out the application form, I received online training and was ready to help.

On February 22nd, patient number one was announced in the news. I received a formal activation from my regional reference in Lombardia, Dr.ssa Sabrina Manzi and I started service in UDC (Crisis Unit in Lombardia) as a part of SeP to provide psychological support for the Red Cross volunteers and staff.

<b>How has the coronavirus outbreak changed your daily life?</b>
My life is changed a lot, like everybody else. As soon as the cities were put in lockdown my life was split between Red Cross and home. In Milan everything changed, we cannot go out, we have to maintain social distances and we must wear masks.
<b>What have you learned from the Coronavirus Outbreak?</b>
I learned that a pandemic emergency is completely different than operating in a disaster emergency.

As the days go by, we improved our services recieving more calls every day h24, 7x7. By the end of February, the Bergamo’s Fire Brigade and OPL (Order of Psychologist of Lombardia) asked us to provide support also for population and non-red Cross various other groups. We worked hard, splitting our time between our day to day jobs in the regional healthcare systems and here in Red Cross.
<b>How has the coronavirus outbreak changed your daily life?</b>
My life is changed a lot, like everybody else. As soon as the cities were put in lockdown my life was split between Red Cross and home. In Milan everything changed, we cannot go out, we have to maintain social distances and we must wear masks.
<b>What have you learned from the Coronavirus Outbreak?</b>
I learned that a pandemic emergency is completely different than operating in a disaster emergency. We are used to be there physically for people but now we cannot be there, everything is done remotely. This is an invisible enemy that reaches out to everyone and everywhere changing not only a specific lifestyle but the whole world, taking away basic freedom, revolutionizing our lifestyles fearing everything and everybody. Our protocols and procedures are changing and adapting as we learn something new about this virus and this creates instability.
<b>In the context of Coronavirus, what have you done that makes you proud?</b>
I’m proud of my team, how we’re holding on and support each other in these difficult times, staying calm, professional with only one goal: caring for each other and the population.
<b>As a volunteer, what is the main challenge during this COVID-19 outbreak?</b>
Support my colleagues and other volunteers, holding onto my emotions and always be ready to quickly adapt to changes.
<b>What have you seen for the first time because of Coronavirus?</b>
My colleagues and people fears and fragility. The reactions are different from what I experienced so far and I saw in my professional and volunteer life.
<b>Can you tell us how hope can rise from Coronavirus response?</b>
To see the light at the end of the tunnel is a necessity, also for myself. It helps me knowing that I’m part of the team that works to help people to psychological support.",,Yes,,,PSS/Psycho-social support/mental health

Tell us your story?</b>
When all of this started, back on the 21<sup>st</sup> of February, I was away for training in the city of Bologna, after the first case was announced, the reaction was immediate and in a matter of few hours, through a growing feeling of fear, I decided to return in Lombardia in Lodi to better understand what was happening first hand.  When I arrived, I had to immediately face 3 major problem factors:
<ol>
 	<li>The ignorance that originated fear mixed with rage;</li>
 	<li>The lack of preparation, it has always been clear to us how to handle emergencies where we act as rescuers and the others are the victims, but this time was not clear (and maybe it is still not clear today) how to manage an emergency where we are both rescuers and victims at the same time;</li>
 	<li>The lack of information.</li>
</ol>
From that day onwards, it has been a growing and continuous escalation of necessities that made us promptly react and build an organized structured approach to guarantee health care assistance for all the volunteers and operators affected and involved.
The very first need we addressed was to take care of our team, while they were taking care of the general public victims, nobody was taking care of their health and wellbeing.
Our staff needed information, guidance, healthcare, and physiological support, certainties; the most difficult thing to provide when you are fighting against something you do not know.
<b>How has the coronavirus outbreak changed your daily life?</b>
SARS-COV2 changes one's priorities, before I thought about what to do after work or a shift and complained about the fact I had to work weekends, now I have only one thing in my mind, find a way to improve the situation, to make things better. You cannot see your parents o your loved ones because you fear you could be the source of the infection, and you want to protect them. SARS-COV2 took away from us the basic and essential thing, sleep, affection even the possibility to go out for a walk for some fresh air. You have to ask yourself if this damages more of your lungs or your mind.
<b>What have you learned from the Coronavirus Outbreak?</b>
As crazy as it may sound, SARS-COV2 allowed realizing what it seemed impossible. The different functions and structures created a network exchanging important information, computerized systems are growing fast allowing everybody to share vital information and enabling cooperation in a climate of solidarity as one team. Volunteers do not look at their uniforms, but they are all working united towards the same common goal. If it’s true that an emergency brings out the real nature of people, we can say that coronavirus brought out the best qualities of all of us.
<b>In the context of Coronavirus, what have you done that makes you proud?</b>
I am proud to be here. I make decisions every day, I ask myself if I am doing the right thing, I am often scared to make mistakes, but I am proud to be here.
If I could turn back time, I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.
<b>As a volunteer, what is the main challenge during this COVID-19 outbreak?</b>
Make volunteers/staff, accept the importance of the restrictive actions and measures we implemented and the importance of their role handling this pandemic. To succeed into let our rescuers understand that they are not immune from this virus and that, without compliance with these rules, not only they can become victims themselves but also they can become the source of diffusion of this infection.

218366,Hola una vez me propuso,http://future-rcrc.com/testimonial/hola-una-vez-me-propuso/,4/17/2020,,"Hola una vez me propuso Cruz Roja Española hacer voluntariado desde mi casa llamando por teléfono a personas mayores para conocer su estado de salud y que no se sintieran solos. Pero cuando pinché en el enlace para inscribirme, me apareció un mensaje en la pantalla que decía que las plazas ya están cubiertas por lo que decidí no salir de casa, que es mejor, y así quiero mostrar mi solidaridad con los sanitarios para no colapsar los hospitales. Ayer me llamó una compañera de CRUZ ROJA para interesarse por mí y me dijo que estáis llamando a todos los voluntarios para ver cómo estamos y me dijo que lo que había decidido de quedarme en casa es lo mejor. Lo que de verdad siento es no haber hecho ese voluntariado de las llamadas a las personas mayores, enfermos y personas vulnerables, ya que quería hacerlo porque no hacía falta que saliera de casa pero ya os digo, estaba todo cubierto. Así que decidí hacer caso a las autoridades sanitarias y quedarme en casa. Por lo demás, Cruz Roja Española está haciendo una gran labor en estos momentos tan difíciles y yo me siento cada vez más orgulloso de pertenecer a Cruz Roja. Llegáis los primeros cuando hay algún desastre natural para ayudar en cualquier lugar del mundo. Llevo en Cruz Roja de Aranjuez desde 2016 y mi referente de voluntariado es buenísima conmigo y con mi novia, que se hizo voluntaria también para ayudar. Pues está es mi experiencia y, si sale alguna otra cosa que pueda hacer desde mi casa, no dudéis en poneros en contacto conmigo. Un saludo cordial.

But when I clicked on the link to register, I appeared a message on the screen saying that the squares are already covered so I decided not to leave home, it's better, and so I want to show my solidarity with health to avoid overburdening the hospitals. Yesterday I called a fellow RED CROSS to be interested in me and told me that you are calling all volunteers to see how we are and told me that he had decided to stay home is best. What really feel is not doing that volunteer calls to the elderly, sick and vulnerable people, as I wanted to because there was no need to leave the house but as I say, it was all covered. So I decided to ignore the health authorities and stay home. Moreover, Spanish Red Cross is doing a great job in these difficult times and I am increasingly proud to belong to the Red Cross.

They tell us to stay at home and most of the people are obeying the rules, but I can’t. I am outside from morning till night to protect them because they are under high-risk groups. As a Volunteer, I represent Red Cross Society and cooperating with the Government administration Department. And with my group of Volunteers, I collect and sort it our packages for people who are above 70 years old, living alone and are within vulnerable groups, also for families with many children to reduce consequences of COVID-19. We have 830 beneficiaries in 3 districts. We have communication with them, bring packages to the destination and trying them to understand how to avoid all dangers connected to Corona Virus and ask them to stay home.  Our volunteers make notes after delivering products and we have a list of addresses, where we have to come back in 10 days.  We have all information about our Volunteers, in which destinations they have been. If someone has some sort of symptoms, we will know who is under high-risk in the group.

Before everything started, Georgia Red Cross Society created National Disaster Response Team. So we had trainings about First Aid, Psychosocial help, Disaster Response. So we trained during 7 days and the last day of our trainings, we knew that COVID-19 was starting spreading in Georgia. We went to places, there were many people and we gave them fliers, where was written recommendations. After that, we recorded video and talk about how to protect ourselves and help prevent spreading the virus to others. Every day people are listening recommendations from Television, what we recorded. We started standing in airports for thermal screening to save resources of medics. The most important thing is, that we have equipments, we are protect all rules of safety.

The first days were so stressful, thinking that we were alone and couldn’t overcome some issues. We didn’t know how to handle it, but everything changed at the speed of light with huge help of many volunteers, who brought peace and hope in our hearts.

At the beginning of the Pandemic, COVID-19 we bought everything we could at markets. We thought only for ourselves, which almost started a crisis. But today it’s different when we buy something for our family, we add some products for others as well. We’ve changed for a better way, we started caring for older members of our society. Have you ever seen so many grateful faces of people? I’ve never had, but I have now and always will remember.

Now we are the one, we are supporting each other, realizing how much does only one kind word mean, how important is to hug one another when you can’t and it’s the really big emotional level of our lives. And we understand how grateful is to take care of someone and when someone takes care of you.

I received a warmhearted letter, where there was mentioned: ""One person’s action pushes another to be inspired of doing something great.‘’  So now the girl who wrote the letter wants to engage in volunteering activities.

Several days ago our volunteer gave me handmade socks for older people and told me, that it was knitted by her 74 years old mother, who wanted it to be taken to beneficiaries.  It was very emotional, everyone trying to do their best.

In my opinion, after everything will be over, our world will become a little heaven for a while, because I deeply believe, that a person can definitely be a light in another person’s life.

This was after the first case was announced in Kenya. We all got into a panic mode but adhered.

On Sunday evening, 15th March after the president of Kenya announced all public places should be closed and people to work from home, that is when it dawned on me that coronavirus disease is officially in town. Sph is a community center and we all work with the youth to develop each other. I went to the office, picked up my belongings and came back home to create a new vision board and goals.

On Tuesday afternoon, the chairman of Kenya Red Cross Society Mombasa County, Mr. Mahmoud Boor called me and asked if I could get talented youth who could sensitize passengers using the ferry to cross, to wash their hands. The handwashing activity began immediately since it was the first cheapest measure to take as protection from the virus. Taps were built and people were being urged to wash their hands whenever they crossed the ferry. This was also to remind them that they should wash their hands wherever they are. He told me ""I want you to tell a story. Create an impact on the people who are not here and let them know what is happening""
I came in when people were still washing hands at the ferry area. I helped the volunteers in serving the liquid soap for commuters in order for them to wash their hands and also create awareness of the then newly announced coronavirus disease.

Recently, together with my colleagues from the communication team, we tweeted a photo of a lady who used bottles to cover their mouths and noses to prevent COVID--19. All this credit goes to the photographer. I am so proud of him and a member of Swahilipot Hub execute team, we have a huge surprise for him once we overcome this pandemic. I am glad the photo went viral and the governor, Mombasa County looked for this lady and helped her financially. He stated that she is among very few people who really cannot afford and aren't ignorant. My aim is to show people who are online on how the real situation on the ground is like. Motivate people and give people hope that it is all going to be okay. Brighter days are coming.

In as much as we all receive bulk SMS and reminders from World Health Organization and The Kenya Red Cross Society, we need individuals who are going to be reminding the online users regularly on the importance of taking precautions and staying safe. Most of the youth in our times ignore messages from official senders but check messages from individuals they follow or relate with. That is why it is my duty to make sure the people who are at home and spend time online really know that COVID-19 is real out here, people are actually falling sick and measures are being taken.

Sharing photos about social distancing and the disinfectant spray booth passage at the Kenya ferry will put some sense in that person who is indoors for them to keep on staying in, for their own safety, or come out only when necessary and making sure they are well protected.

The chairman Mombasa Branch, Mr. Mahmoud Noor has been using local radio stations to educate the community on how they can protect themselves, and provide useful information to minimise myths going around about the disease and it is our work to spread out the information that he gives. To make sure it is heard nationally and internationally.

Finally, I thank the Kenya RedCross Mombasa branch for organizing training sessions to all the COVID-19 response team on the whole corona Virus Disease 2019. It's myths and facts, did and don't and most importantly, our role as volunteers. What we really are supposed to do and how we also are going to protect ourselves as we help others.",Kenya Red Cross Society,KE,English,en,Shufaa,https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSC_0058-01-scaled.jpg,,,I purpose to share inspirational and educative information about what is happening on ground,"On Friday, 13th March 2020 our patron, Swahilipot Hub who is also the chair of the board SwahiliPot Hub and KRCS Mombasa County, call in at work and asked us to stock in sanitizers and also organise hand washing water before the entrance of the building. This was after the first case was announced in Kenya. We all got into a panic mode but adhered.

On Sunday evening, 15th March after the president of Kenya announced all public places should be closed and people to work from home, that is when it dawned on me that coronavirus disease is officially in town. Sph is a community center and we all work with the youth to develop each other. I went to the office, picked up my belongings and came back home to create a new vision board and goals.

On Tuesday afternoon, the chairman of Kenya Red Cross Society Mombasa County, Mr. Mahmoud Boor called me and asked if I could get talented youth who could sensitize passengers using the ferry to cross, to wash their hands. The handwashing activity began immediately since it was the first cheapest measure to take as protection from the virus. Taps were built and people were being urged to wash their hands whenever they crossed the ferry. This was also to remind them that they should wash their hands wherever they are. He told me ""I want you to tell a story. Create an impact on the people who are not here and let them know what is happening""
I came in when people were still washing hands at the ferry area. I helped the volunteers in serving the liquid soap for commuters in order for them to wash their hands and also create awareness of the then newly announced coronavirus disease.

Recently, together with my colleagues from the communication team, we tweeted a photo of a lady who used bottles to cover their mouths and noses to prevent COVID--19. All this credit goes to the photographer. I am so proud of him and a member of Swahilipot Hub execute team, we have a huge surprise for him once we overcome this pandemic. I am glad the photo went viral and the governor, Mombasa County looked for this lady and helped her financially. He stated that she is among very few people who really cannot afford and aren't ignorant. My aim is to show people who are online on how the real situation on the ground is like. Motivate people and give people hope that it is all going to be okay. Brighter days are coming.

In as much as we all receive bulk SMS and reminders from World Health Organization and The Kenya Red Cross Society, we need individuals who are going to be reminding the online users regularly on the importance of taking precautions and staying safe. Most of the youth in our times ignore messages from official senders but check messages from individuals they follow or relate with. That is why it is my duty to make sure the people who are at home and spend time online really know that COVID-19 is real out here, people are actually falling sick and measures are being taken.

Sharing photos about social distancing and the disinfectant spray booth passage at the Kenya ferry will put some sense in that person who is indoors for them to keep on staying in, for their own safety, or come out only when necessary and making sure they are well protected.

The chairman Mombasa Branch, Mr. Mahmoud Noor has been using local radio stations to educate the community on how they can protect themselves, and provide useful information to minimise myths going around about the disease and it is our work to spread out the information that he gives. To make sure it is heard nationally and internationally.

Finally, I thank the Kenya RedCross Mombasa branch for organizing training sessions to all the COVID-19 response team on the whole corona Virus Disease 2019.

Esto no quiere decir que todo sea color de rosa, pero creo que las cosas buenas deben ser resaltadas. En la región de las Américas, muchos países han demostrado que actuar y tomar decisiones innovadoras, reconocer medidas no tradicionales y abogar por los más vulnerables es necesario, incluso antes de la pandemia y quizás ha sido esta misma pandemia la que los ha forzado a aplicar algunos cambios. Como ejemplo de estas medidas innovadoras se puede mencionar:

– el caso de Bolivia, que ha adoptado el uso de plantas medicionales que fortalezcan el sistema inmunológico, otorgándole un valor extraordinario a los conocimientos ancestrales indígenas y dando oportunidad a nuevos (o antiguos) métodos de medicina.

– En Chile, se han aplicado medidas pensando en los hijos de padres separados, de manera que puedan estar con ambos padres. Pensando en la educación, el gobierno chileno ha entregado 122 mil computadoras con conexión gratuita a internet.

– En ese mismo sentido, Colombia ha lanzado una convocatoria para postular proyectos de alfabetización.

– En Argentina se ha reconocido el COVID-19 como una enfermedad de caracter profesional, pensando en la futura estabilidad de los trabajadores.

218587,Innovations in COVID Series – Personal Protective Equipment,http://future-rcrc.com/testimonial/innovations-in-covid-series/,4/24/2020,,"<p>Because of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis all over the world is facing a lack of PPE, especially face masks and face shields. I had little idea and thought some why we can’t make face shield? I went shopping for some items and made face shields. Just checked. Really. It is very good. It protects my full face. Now I am using this for face contact and aerosol procedures with my nursing staff.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><em>Volunteer Story from Qatar Red Crescent Society <a href=""https://future-rcrc.com/testimonial/prepare-face-shield-by-my-self-ppe/"">Prepare face shield by myself (PPE)</a></em></p>
<hr /> 
<p style=""text-align: left;"">From volunteers working in their communities to clinicians caring for patients, one of the first global needs that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic was a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This need is not new, and as the RCRC we have seen our staff diligently working at all different levels to address supply shortages in our programming.</p>
<p>We would like to highlight four different challenges linked to the global PPE shortage, and different opportunities and innovations popping up to address these needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Local Fabrication of PPE</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>The Challenge: </strong></h5>
<p>While international bodies are working together to coordinate the resupply of essential PPE to National Societies, there is a shortage in local markets of supplies. Black markets are taking advantage of this opportunity and charging exorbitant prices for small quantities of equipment.</p>
<p><img src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Story-4_PPE-02-1.png"" width=""900"" height=""610"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-219006 aligncenter size-full"" /></p>
<h5><strong>The Response:</strong></h5>
<p>While locally manufactured masks are not a replacement of critical PPE used by health workers, where facemasks are not available some countries are recommending the use of homemade masks. It is important to note that in a healthcare worker context, cloth face masks may be more dangerous than no face masks. Several National Societies are mobilizing their volunteers and their networks in the production of essential PPE, including face shields and masks.</p>
<p>One example of this is the Malaysian Red Crescent Society (MRCS), who has been organizing local mask production by their volunteers. These masks are distributed to vulnerable communities, such as the homeless, migrant workers, refugees, and the elderly, along with other essential hygiene commodities. MRCS is also using volunteers to produce face shields to support front-line health workers while they are waiting for a resupply of commercial medical face shields. In the span of 6 days, volunteers were able to produce around 30,000 face shields.</p>
<p>In Malaysia they’ve also scaled up production by working with prisons to engage prisoners in the production of equipment and collaborating with universities to use their engineering labs for PPE production. The National Society’s #responsMalaysia campaign has gained a lot of attention in the country, and they’ve received hundreds of thousands of donated PPE from local companies and organizations.</p>
<p>Similar stories of mobilization and coordination to meet local needs are popping up all over the globe, from Thailand where the Thai Red Cross Society has organized volunteers from 76 provinces to produce face masks, to Kazakhstan where nine regional branches have produced and distributed 2600 masks. National Societies, such as the Latvian Red Cross, are also working hand-in-hand with governments to negotiate and encourage local companies to produce masks and gowns, which can help boost local economies.</p>
<p>The importance of local manufacturing is that individuals and companies cannot develop PPE at a large scale and cannot always channel goods to the beneficiaries. Local champions in National societies can be the channel to meet local needs.</p>

<p><strong>For branches and National Societies looking to respond to their local shortages, we have collected several resources for you:</strong></p>

<hr /> 
<p style=""text-align: left;"">From volunteers working in their communities to clinicians caring for patients, one of the first global needs that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic was a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This need is not new, and as the RCRC we have seen our staff diligently working at all different levels to address supply shortages in our programming.</p>
<p>We would like to highlight four different challenges linked to the global PPE shortage, and different opportunities and innovations popping up to address these needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Local Fabrication of PPE</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>The Challenge: </strong></h5>
<p>While international bodies are working together to coordinate the resupply of essential PPE to National Societies, there is a shortage in local markets of supplies. Black markets are taking advantage of this opportunity and charging exorbitant prices for small quantities of equipment.</p>
<p><img src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Story-4_PPE-02-1.png"" width=""900"" height=""610"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-219006 aligncenter size-full"" /></p>
<h5><strong>The Response:</strong></h5>
<p>While locally manufactured masks are not a replacement of critical PPE used by health workers, where facemasks are not available some countries are recommending the use of homemade masks. It is important to note that in a healthcare worker context, cloth face masks may be more dangerous than no face masks. Several National Societies are mobilizing their volunteers and their networks in the production of essential PPE, including face shields and masks.</p>
<p>One example of this is the Malaysian Red Crescent Society (MRCS), who has been organizing local mask production by their volunteers. These masks are distributed to vulnerable communities, such as the homeless, migrant workers, refugees, and the elderly, along with other essential hygiene commodities. MRCS is also using volunteers to produce face shields to support front-line health workers while they are waiting for a resupply of commercial medical face shields. In the span of 6 days, volunteers were able to produce around 30,000 face shields.</p>
<p>In Malaysia they’ve also scaled up production by working with prisons to engage prisoners in the production of equipment and collaborating with universities to use their engineering labs for PPE production. The National Society’s #responsMalaysia campaign has gained a lot of attention in the country, and they’ve received hundreds of thousands of donated PPE from local companies and organizations.</p>
<p>Similar stories of mobilization and coordination to meet local needs are popping up all over the globe, from Thailand where the Thai Red Cross Society has organized volunteers from 76 provinces to produce face masks, to Kazakhstan where nine regional branches have produced and distributed 2600 masks. National Societies, such as the Latvian Red Cross, are also working hand-in-hand with governments to negotiate and encourage local companies to produce masks and gowns, which can help boost local economies.</p>
<p>The importance of local manufacturing is that individuals and companies cannot develop PPE at a large scale and cannot always channel goods to the beneficiaries. Local champions in National societies can be the channel to meet local needs.</p>

<p><strong>For branches and National Societies looking to respond to their local shortages, we have collected several resources for you:</strong></p>

En tiempos en los que Cruz Roja ha desarrollado un plan sin precedentes en su historia, la comunicación institucional es piedra angular.

While I was expecting to work closely with NRCS on the concept note that would materialize soon, one of the Officers in NRCS said: “We are about to activate the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for COVID-19 response and you may contribute as a volunteer in the same unit”. As being a public health student, I was able to grab the opportunity and looking forward to a wonderful experience. After some preparatory work, on 6<sup>th</sup> Feb, EOC was activated. I and my friend of the same academic background joined there. We were first oriented about the role of EOC and secondly with our assigned task. Our responsibility was to collect various activities and information from 77 districts of Nepal and to draft a daily situation report on COVID-19.

Basically, the Red Cross is mainly known for working in emergency situation for humanitarian response. As COVID-19 was new for all of us. And, working in an emergency situation is really not an easy thing. But it has enhanced my problem-solving and stress coping skills as well. On one side I was grabbing the opportunity and, on another side, I was facing challenges also. But continuous guidance and supervision from internal staff, as well as appropriate cooperation from districts, made easier to perform the assigned task.

Besides this, I was anxious because globally confirmed cases were increasing rapidly and it was spreading across the country. I used to imagine that developed countries like the USA, UK, Italy, and others were struggling to react efficiently in COVID-19 situations and what would be in the case of Nepal?

Until March 23<sup>rd</sup> there was only one case recorded and that has been recovered also. Everything was fine until then. The second case was reported on this same date in Nepal thus, lockdown started. Moreover, we were said to work from home. Staying at home for a long time made me bored but the situation was like that and I used to satisfy myself. On 13<sup>th</sup> April which is also Nepali New Year, two people from my apartment tested positive for COVID-19. It was big national news over here. I was stressed because a large number of media with big cameras and police had surrounded us and we were sealed.  For at least two days, my phone was busy receiving calls and replying messages from a number of people and saying the same things all the time i.e. we are fine and they were from different towers. Fortunately, around 300 people tested for COVID-19, all were negative, and these things made the entire apartment people very happy.

Khaled (45), who is busy fighting the spread of COVID-19, has been away from home since March 5 and can only communicate with his family via phone calls and social media.</p>
<p>“Ever since the first Coronavirus cases appeared in Palestine in early March, the Society’s EMS Center in Jenin decided to allocate an EMT and an ambulance for the transportation of suspected cases”, Khaled said.</p>
<p>“Following consultations with my colleagues at the Center, it was decided to task me with that mission. My entire day is spent transporting patients potentially infected with COVID-19, mainly from Israeli checkpoints to quarantine centers or hospitals, but also from homes to testing centers. I also transport healthcare personnel responsible for conducting tests"", he added.</p>

<p>Khaled explained: ""so far, in Jenin, there are four confirmed cases and tens of suspected ones. Every day, I transport around ten suspected cases in full coordination with the MoH Preventive Medicine Services. Even though PRCS ensures that all preventive and protective measures are respected, the fact that I deal on a daily basis with this virus makes going home risky for my family. This is why I prefer to talk to them on the phone, or from the sidewalk without entering my house"".</p>
<p>""If there’s anything they need, I leave it outside the door. I couldn’t go home even on my son’s birthday and had to wish him a happy birthday over the phone. I did this to protect him and my family. There are many other EMTs who are on the front line of the COVID-19 fight, and none of them has gone home for so many days now”, Khaled added.</p>

The years she has spent volunteering have shaped her personality, made her an active member of society and increased her awareness and commitment to her town, friends and family.

Salma first heard about COVID-19 on local radio. “I then attended an awareness-raising workshop held by PRCS on COVID-19 in Anabta, and communicated the basic health messages conveyed to us to other community members to help them protect themselves and prevent the spread of the virus. I did this in a simple and reassuring manner without stoking fear or panic in the community”, she said.

Speaking about her personal experience with COVID-19, Salma added: “My husband works inside Israel. He spent an entire month away from home, but with the rapid spread of the virus and the many calls for workers to return to their villages, he decided to come home along with eight other workers from the town. When they reached the nearest checkpoint to Anabta, I called PRCS and asked for the phone number of the Preventive Medicine Unit which I immediately contacted.

My husband and his colleagues then reported to the COVID-19 testing center. None of them tested positive but they all had to self-quarantine for 14 days. When this happened, I realized the importance of the health messages and preventive measures I learned through the PRCS workshop. I called the wives of my husband’s colleagues and explained to them that no one should hug, kiss or touch their husbands and that they needed to be isolated. We all agreed to keep in touch and to contact PRCS should we have questions on how to deal with infected family members.

In my house, my husband had to use a separate bedroom and bathroom. I washed all his clothes separately and served him his meals in disposable plates. None of us came within 2 meters from him. I also called PRCS and they sent volunteers to disinfect my house. It was very difficult for my husband to stay away from his grandchildren whom he missed a lot. But he knew that he had to protect them by respecting social distancing measures”.

Salma believes that defeating COVID-19 requires a strong will, commitment, understanding and awareness. “Above all, do not panic and keep a cool head because panicking will overwhelm you and prevent you from working effectively to prevent the spread of the virus.

219013,Innovations in COVID Series – Local Detection & Tracking of COVID,http://future-rcrc.com/?post_type=wpm-testimonial&p=219013,4/29/2020,,"<h2>Public Health Measures to Prevent and Suppress Transmission</h2>
Do we really know the true scope and spread of COVID-19? Even the highest resourced settings are struggling to track the virus as it spreads and understand the implications on different communities. In the complex settings where the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement works, this challenge is further compounded by ongoing migration, rural communities disconnected from national reporting, and vulnerable groups who do not have access to testing and care.

In order to make meaningful decisions concerning resource allocation during COVID-19, public health tools which allow us to measure, understand, and plan around transmission can provide valuable information.

<strong>Community Based Surveillance</strong>

<strong>The Challenge: </strong>In rural communities, where there is a lack of digital infrastructure, traditional surveillance systems are often ineffective in timely detection of outbreaks.

<strong>The Opportunity:</strong>

Community-based surveillance (CBS) is the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within a community by community members, and an approach the RCRC movement has been exploring for several years.

In February 2020, the Norwegian Red Cross launched a new platform for CBS called <a href=""https://www.cbsrc.org/what-is-nyss"">Nyss</a>. Nyss (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=784IzOIkzJE&amp;feature=emb_logo"">short video introduction</a>) is the result of multiple volunteer codeathons, where over 250 volunteers from several countries contributed to the realization of the platform. Currently being used in Senegal and Somaliland, Nyss allows for real-time detection, reporting, aggregation, and analysis of community health risks. With the rapid spreading of COVID-19, the Nyss users quickly identified the potential value added of using CBS and Nyss to also detect potential cases of COVID-19 in the communities.

Volunteers were quickly trained in the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and how to report any potential cases to Nyss. Following this, Nyss was used to detect one of the first two cases in Somaliland (<a href=""https://www.rodekors.no/en/english-pages/cbs-and-nyss/somaliland-corona-transmissions-stopped-by-mobile-phone/"">full story</a>).

Some of the features that enabled this success were:
<ul>
         <li>Strong support network between RC community health volunteers collecting data and their supervisors.</li>
         <li>System for monthly refresher trainings already in place.</li>
         <li>Simple technological infrastructure – volunteers report to Nyss by sending a simple, coded SMS from their feature phones, decreasing the barrier to usage.</li>
         <li>Collaboration between the health authorities and the National Society, which allowed alerts to feed into a fast response system.</li>
         <li>Volunteer literacy not needed to report data to Nyss.</li>
</ul>
What is next for this new platform? Nyss is intended to be the core CBS-tool within the Movement, and there is also increasing interest from outside actors. For urban and higher-resourced communities with smart phones, a mobile app is also in the pipeline.

<strong>Self-Reporting Symptoms</strong>

<strong>The Challenge: </strong>A sufficient supply of COVID-19 tests is still limited in most, if not all, countries. New ways of tracking the spread of the virus can help supplement testing efforts and answer open questions linked to COVID.

<strong>The Opportunity:</strong>

While self-reported symptoms are hardly a reliable indicator of actual COVID-19 spread, they can be a signal which can support researchers and public health professionals to understand currently unanswered questions. This includes how the disease clusters, high-risks areas, high-spread areas, symptoms in different populations, and the affect of different public health interventions.

The need for tracking and reporting on COVID has been identified by many companies and groups, which increases the risk of spreading data over multiple platforms and diluting its accuracy and impact. It also brings up important questions around data security. In the review of existing platforms and apps there are several tools which stand out.

<a href=""https://covid.joinzoe.com/"">COVID-19 Symptom Tracker app</a> has been developed by King’s College London and health science company ZOE, and it is endorsed by the Welsh Government, NHS Wales, the Scottish Government and NHS Scotland. At the time of reporting, more than 2.5 million participants have downloaded the app and are using it to regularly report on their health. The app developers have updated the app to reach more elderly users by allowing multiple user profiles, so that family, friends or caregivers can log daily health reports on behalf of anyone who wishes to take part in the study but does not have access to a smartphone. The app is now being used in the USA in addition to the UK. All research findings coming out of the data are available on <a href=""https://covid.joinzoe.com/us-blog"">an open blog</a>.

<img class=""wp-image-219034"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image.png"" />

A similar app, <a href=""https://howwefeel.org/"">How We Feel</a>, is supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation among others. Something innovative and interesting about this app is that every time the app is downloaded, they will donate a meal through Feeding America. What makes this app stand out is the usability – It’s free, simple to set up, and requires very minimal data input. The design is meant to encourage daily interactions.

A slightly different model is being tested by the Danish Ministry of Health, where Danish citizens who sign up to <a href=""file:///Users/ylfch/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail%20Downloads/1D58A3BF-3D02-41C9-8242-4AB253386670/c-19%20dk"">C19.DK</a> receive a daily text message which includes a simple health status survey. At the time of this article, only 32,531 citizens had signed up, as COVID-19 infections are currently on the decrease in Denmark. The software is open source (hosted on GitHub) and the developers are interested in spreading this technology to other interested countries.

<img class=""wp-image-219035"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-1.png"" />

A non-smartphone related platform, the ‘Covid Near You’ map, was developed by Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. On <a href=""https://www.covidnearyou.org/"">this website</a>, community members can self-register whether they have had symptoms correlated with Covid-19 and whether they’ve had testing. The platform, which originally started in the US, has already expanded to Canada and Mexico.

<img class=""wp-image-219036"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-2.png"" />

For National Societies considering using or developing self-reporting apps in their community engagement, it is important to investigate whether local governments have already endorsed or created an app for this purpose. Many governments, such as <a href=""https://helsenorge.no/koronavirus/koronasmitte"">Norway</a>, <a href=""https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/"">India</a> (who’s app is available for download in 11 languages), and <a href=""https://news.itu.int/ghana-launches-covid-19-tracker-app/"">Ghana</a>, have already launched apps, and others, such as Australia and New Zealand, have repurposed previously existing platforms (<a href=""https://info.flutracking.net/"">FluTracking</a> – an influenza monitoring app). The Ghanian app, developed by <a href=""https://www.redbird.co/"">RedBird Health Tech</a>, is planning to roll out to Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.

<strong>Digital Tracing</strong>

<strong>The Challenge: </strong>Social distancing has been extremely difficult to maintain, sustain, and reinforce in many settings. We also have seen that many people are shedding viruses before they show symptoms and unintentionally infect those they encounter.

<strong>The Opportunity:</strong>

Since COVID-19 can be transmitted through contact with affected individuals, public health officials have identified contact tracing as a valuable tool to help contain its spread. The hope is that those who have come into contact with someone who has corona can self-isolate before infecting others. Compared to the self-reporting of symptoms, tools for contact tracing look at interactions and movement of people.

One of the first National Societies to actively incorporate contact tracing into their national response was the Austrian Red Cross. In collaboration with Accenture and the Austrian Government Crises Management Team, the team rapidly developed an launched an application called <a href=""https://participate.roteskreuz.at/faq_stopp_corona_app/"">Stopp Corona</a>. The Stopp Corona app contains a contact diary, where personal encounters are saved anonymously. If someone tests positive to COVID-19, or begins to show symptoms, all contacts from the past 54 hours will be notified.

<img class=""wp-image-219037"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-3.png"" />

Since the launch of the app, several National Societies, from Germany to Australia and Namibia, have been in dialogue with the Austrian RCS in order to explore expanding the platform to their setting. The app is available open source through GitHub.

Several National Societies in Europe have been in dialogue with Apple and Google to explore using their <a href=""https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/"">joint COVID-19 tracing tool</a>. The Netherlands RC has also been looking to develop principles to help guide National Societies to decide if and how to engage responsibly in contact tracing for COVID-19.

The first phase of the project is an API (interface which allows software to communicate) that public health agencies can integrate into their own apps. The next phase is a system-level contact tracing system that will work across iOS and Android devices. The system will use Bluetooth to identify contacts over the past 14 days with whom you have spent a specific threshold of time and proximity with. If that data matches with someone who has self-reported a positive COVID test, you will be alerted to self-quarantine. One of the benefits of this project is having both Apple and Google onboard – Traditionally iOS and Android systems do not work well together, and fragmentation would decrease the effectiveness the of data. In this second phase, the user wouldn’t need to download in app – They could opt-in to their device being directly traced. More specifications can be found <a href=""https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing"">here</a>.

<img class=""wp-image-219038"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-4.png"" /> <img class=""wp-image-219039"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-5.png"" />

While the solution being developed by Apple and Google seem to focus on data security, in general apps for contact tracing and apps containing health data need to have rigorous data protection. Countries outside of Europe, who are not protected by GDPR rules, should particularly review the risk-benefit analysis.

<strong>Mobility &amp; Risk Reporting</strong>

<strong>The Challenge: </strong>In many of the countries where we work, complete country lockdown is impractical and often impossible. Understanding how certain populations are moving, whether that is within urban slums or rural IDP camps, can help us understand exposure in many of the settings we work. It can also help Movement actors see the impact of different public health and community engagement interventions. Many of us also see the risk of COVID-19 placing already vulnerable communities at a further risk, and being able to conduct risk scenario planning can help us better allocate resources.

<strong>The Opportunity</strong>

Contact tracing focuses on the <em>who</em>, not the <em>where</em>. Mobility data is the opposite.

One of the easiest ways to track mobility is through platforms where people are already sharing their mobility, i.e. virtual maps. Tech giants, who have been collecting data of hundreds of millions of users for years, have been sharing that data as part of the COVID response.

Apple has been producing mobility trends (accessible for cities, countries, and regions) through using aggregated data collected from Apple Maps. <img class=""wp-image-219040"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-6.png"" />

Their <a href=""https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility"">new website</a> currently offers mobility trends for 63 countries. Apple Maps generates the data by counting requests for directions. The data sets are then compared to reflect a change in volume of people driving, walking or taking public transit around the world. It is important to note that data availability in a particular city, country, or region is influenced by a number of factors (such as people using other navigation services). Google has produced a very <a href=""https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/"">similar website</a> with mobility reports, except that their data is linked to users who have Location History enabled. Both providers offer free download of the data.

Facebook has been collaborating with the <a href=""https://www.covid19mobility.org/"">COVID-19 Mobility Data Network</a> to contribute aggregated mobility data (the <a href=""https://visualization.covid19mobility.org/"">Facebook dashboard</a> is currently displaying data for the United States only). They do offer additional tools specifically for nonprofits, including a <a href=""https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/disease-prevention-maps/"">Disease Prevention Map</a> which shows population density, movement, and cellular connectivity. This tool can be used to look at trends on staying near home and general mobility patterns, including using the data to model different mobility scenarios and model to visualize overlapping risks, such as flood risk incidence.

A similar project within the Movement is being led by the Netherland’s 510 team. The team has created a COVID vulnerability index, where they have been feeding in data from multiple sources to compare COVID outbreak to overlapping vulnerability, such as a risk of a secondary natural disaster or higher incidence of non-communicable diseases. This data has been used nationally to predict distribution of resources and map out future COVID-19 scenarios. 510 is now looking to expand the work to additional National Societies in other parts of the world.

Do we really know the true scope and spread of COVID-19? Even the highest resourced settings are struggling to track the virus as it spreads and understand the implications on different communities. In the complex settings where the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement works, this challenge is further compounded by ongoing migration, rural communities disconnected from national reporting, and vulnerable groups who do not have access to testing and care.

In order to make meaningful decisions concerning resource allocation during COVID-19, public health tools which allow us to measure, understand, and plan around transmission can provide valuable information.

<strong>Self-Reporting Symptoms</strong>

<strong>The Challenge: </strong>A sufficient supply of COVID-19 tests is still limited in most, if not all, countries. New ways of tracking the spread of the virus can help supplement testing efforts and answer open questions linked to COVID.

<strong>The Opportunity:</strong>

While self-reported symptoms are hardly a reliable indicator of actual COVID-19 spread, they can be a signal which can support researchers and public health professionals to understand currently unanswered questions. This includes how the disease clusters, high-risks areas, high-spread areas, symptoms in different populations, and the affect of different public health interventions.

The need for tracking and reporting on COVID has been identified by many companies and groups, which increases the risk of spreading data over multiple platforms and diluting its accuracy and impact. It also brings up important questions around data security. In the review of existing platforms and apps there are several tools which stand out.

<a href=""https://covid.joinzoe.com/"">COVID-19 Symptom Tracker app</a> has been developed by King’s College London and health science company ZOE, and it is endorsed by the Welsh Government, NHS Wales, the Scottish Government and NHS Scotland. At the time of reporting, more than 2.5 million participants have downloaded the app and are using it to regularly report on their health. The app developers have updated the app to reach more elderly users by allowing multiple user profiles, so that family, friends or caregivers can log daily health reports on behalf of anyone who wishes to take part in the study but does not have access to a smartphone. The app is now being used in the USA in addition to the UK. All research findings coming out of the data are available on <a href=""https://covid.joinzoe.com/us-blog"">an open blog</a>.

<img class=""wp-image-219034"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image.png"" />

A similar app, <a href=""https://howwefeel.org/"">How We Feel</a>, is supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation among others. Something innovative and interesting about this app is that every time the app is downloaded, they will donate a meal through Feeding America. What makes this app stand out is the usability – It’s free, simple to set up, and requires very minimal data input. The design is meant to encourage daily interactions.

A slightly different model is being tested by the Danish Ministry of Health, where Danish citizens who sign up to <a href=""file:///Users/ylfch/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail%20Downloads/1D58A3BF-3D02-41C9-8242-4AB253386670/c-19%20dk"">C19.DK</a> receive a daily text message which includes a simple health status survey. At the time of this article, only 32,531 citizens had signed up, as COVID-19 infections are currently on the decrease in Denmark. The software is open source (hosted on GitHub) and the developers are interested in spreading this technology to other interested countries.

<img class=""wp-image-219035"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-1.png"" />

A non-smartphone related platform, the ‘Covid Near You’ map, was developed by Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. On <a href=""https://www.covidnearyou.org/"">this website</a>, community members can self-register whether they have had symptoms correlated with Covid-19 and whether they’ve had testing. The platform, which originally started in the US, has already expanded to Canada and Mexico.

<img class=""wp-image-219036"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-2.png"" />

For National Societies considering using or developing self-reporting apps in their community engagement, it is important to investigate whether local governments have already endorsed or created an app for this purpose. Many governments, such as <a href=""https://helsenorge.no/koronavirus/koronasmitte"">Norway</a>, <a href=""https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/"">India</a> (who’s app is available for download in 11 languages), and <a href=""https://news.itu.int/ghana-launches-covid-19-tracker-app/"">Ghana</a>, have already launched apps, and others, such as Australia and New Zealand, have repurposed previously existing platforms (<a href=""https://info.flutracking.net/"">FluTracking</a> – an influenza monitoring app). The Ghanian app, developed by <a href=""https://www.redbird.co/"">RedBird Health Tech</a>, is planning to roll out to Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.

<strong>Digital Tracing</strong>

<strong>The Challenge: </strong>Social distancing has been extremely difficult to maintain, sustain, and reinforce in many settings. We also have seen that many people are shedding viruses before they show symptoms and unintentionally infect those they encounter.

<strong>The Opportunity:</strong>

Since COVID-19 can be transmitted through contact with affected individuals, public health officials have identified contact tracing as a valuable tool to help contain its spread. The hope is that those who have come into contact with someone who has corona can self-isolate before infecting others. Compared to the self-reporting of symptoms, tools for contact tracing look at interactions and movement of people.

One of the first National Societies to actively incorporate contact tracing into their national response was the Austrian Red Cross. In collaboration with Accenture and the Austrian Government Crises Management Team, the team rapidly developed an launched an application called <a href=""https://participate.roteskreuz.at/faq_stopp_corona_app/"">Stopp Corona</a>. The Stopp Corona app contains a contact diary, where personal encounters are saved anonymously. If someone tests positive to COVID-19, or begins to show symptoms, all contacts from the past 54 hours will be notified.

<img class=""wp-image-219037"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-3.png"" />

Since the launch of the app, several National Societies, from Germany to Australia and Namibia, have been in dialogue with the Austrian RCS in order to explore expanding the platform to their setting. The app is available open source through GitHub.

Several National Societies in Europe have been in dialogue with Apple and Google to explore using their <a href=""https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/"">joint COVID-19 tracing tool</a>. The Netherlands RC has also been looking to develop principles to help guide National Societies to decide if and how to engage responsibly in contact tracing for COVID-19.

The first phase of the project is an API (interface which allows software to communicate) that public health agencies can integrate into their own apps. The next phase is a system-level contact tracing system that will work across iOS and Android devices. The system will use Bluetooth to identify contacts over the past 14 days with whom you have spent a specific threshold of time and proximity with. If that data matches with someone who has self-reported a positive COVID test, you will be alerted to self-quarantine. One of the benefits of this project is having both Apple and Google onboard – Traditionally iOS and Android systems do not work well together, and fragmentation would decrease the effectiveness the of data. In this second phase, the user wouldn’t need to download in app – They could opt-in to their device being directly traced. More specifications can be found <a href=""https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing"">here</a>.

<img class=""wp-image-219038"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-4.png"" /> <img class=""wp-image-219039"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-5.png"" />

While the solution being developed by Apple and Google seem to focus on data security, in general apps for contact tracing and apps containing health data need to have rigorous data protection. Countries outside of Europe, who are not protected by GDPR rules, should particularly review the risk-benefit analysis.

<strong>Mobility &amp; Risk Reporting</strong>

<strong>The Challenge: </strong>In many of the countries where we work, complete country lockdown is impractical and often impossible. Understanding how certain populations are moving, whether that is within urban slums or rural IDP camps, can help us understand exposure in many of the settings we work. It can also help Movement actors see the impact of different public health and community engagement interventions. Many of us also see the risk of COVID-19 placing already vulnerable communities at a further risk, and being able to conduct risk scenario planning can help us better allocate resources.

<strong>The Opportunity</strong>

Contact tracing focuses on the <em>who</em>, not the <em>where</em>. Mobility data is the opposite.

One of the easiest ways to track mobility is through platforms where people are already sharing their mobility, i.e. virtual maps. Tech giants, who have been collecting data of hundreds of millions of users for years, have been sharing that data as part of the COVID response.

Apple has been producing mobility trends (accessible for cities, countries, and regions) through using aggregated data collected from Apple Maps. <img class=""wp-image-219040"" src=""https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-6.png"" />

Their <a href=""https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility"">new website</a> currently offers mobility trends for 63 countries. Apple Maps generates the data by counting requests for directions. The data sets are then compared to reflect a change in volume of people driving, walking or taking public transit around the world. It is important to note that data availability in a particular city, country, or region is influenced by a number of factors (such as people using other navigation services). Google has produced a very <a href=""https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/"">similar website</a> with mobility reports, except that their data is linked to users who have Location History enabled. Both providers offer free download of the data.

Facebook has been collaborating with the <a href=""https://www.covid19mobility.org/"">COVID-19 Mobility Data Network</a> to contribute aggregated mobility data (the <a href=""https://visualization.covid19mobility.org/"">Facebook dashboard</a> is currently displaying data for the United States only). They do offer additional tools specifically for nonprofits, including a <a href=""https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/disease-prevention-maps/"">Disease Prevention Map</a> which shows population density, movement, and cellular connectivity. This tool can be used to look at trends on staying near home and general mobility patterns, including using the data to model different mobility scenarios and model to visualize overlapping risks, such as flood risk incidence.

A similar project within the Movement is being led by the Netherland’s 510 team. The team has created a COVID vulnerability index, where they have been feeding in data from multiple sources to compare COVID outbreak to overlapping vulnerability, such as a risk of a secondary natural disaster or higher incidence of non-communicable diseases. This data has been used nationally to predict distribution of resources and map out future COVID-19 scenarios. 510 is now looking to expand the work to additional National Societies in other parts of the world.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>How to get started</b></span></p>
<p>First – the best way to learn about a hackathon or a codeathon is to be a participant or an observer. Most of the events are designed to enable all types of skillsets. As humanitarians you have much to offer in terms of ‘problems to be solved’ or ‘guidance on how ideas might support humanitarian action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>What to consider when submitting an ‘idea’ </b>  </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Many hands and eyes can make light. Be sure to define a problem into manageable parts with a context. If you are the ‘idea or project owner’, you and your team should be available throughout the event to ‘mentor’ and guide the idea.   </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This article might assist in those considerations   </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href=""http://textontechs.com/2013/11/stop-hacking-without-specing-a-top-10-needed/"">http://textontechs.com/2013/11/stop-hacking-without-specing-a-top-10-needed/</a></span><span class=""s4"">  </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The best hackathons are really multi-stages projects that lead to some sustainable plan. The risk of not doing this is unused software, which might leave the participants and wider community wondering if the event achieved its outcomes. This can be addressed with messaging and/or programming. One way to do this is to build the ecosystem in which partners can continue to mentor, especially if the project becomes a startup or a collective project.    </span></p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Some alternative views on hackathons.   </span></h4>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When getting involved in a hackathon, it is possible that the solution might not solve a problem. Or, it might not fit humanitarian values. By being a great project mentor and project participant, you can help guide the collective good will to innovate without causing harm. Consider these spaces to be ‘ideation’ and ‘prototypes’ for future plans. Most of all have fun and do tell us how it went.   </span></p>

I wanted to share our story about Covid-19. What did we do during Covid-19? Our Covid-19 adventure started with the first case in Turkey, on 10th March. First of all, as we Turkish Red Crescent Youth Volunteers in Karabuk, we raised the awareness of the society with some posters, short videos, pictures, and a motto which is #stayathome. We wanted to be ready for everything, we started to collect all provisions that we had, and then we put all them in boxes, for use in an emergency. On 27th March, 1724 Algerians were brought to our city by the government and they were hosted 14 days by us in the dormitories. We were just 4 people from the Turkish Red Crescent Youth Karabuk, and we served by giving three meals in a day for all of them. While we giving the meals in a day, we wore white coveralls, masks for protecting ourselves and we kept the distance. The people, who were our guests, showed their satisfaction every day and we all appreciated in every second that we served them. After 14 days of quarantine, they went to their own countries. Now we all are in dormitories again, for caring and serving 3 meals in a day for the people who came from the Czech Republic a week ago.
